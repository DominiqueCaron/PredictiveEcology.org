As promised, we have now incorporated many notes from our June workshop into
the "training book" [Robust and nimble scientific workflows, using SpaDES](training/_book/index.html),
and fixed a few examples that needed attention.

Please have a look again at the troubleshooting section of the book where many of the 
package installation issues reported during the workshop are addressed.

Our work on the book contents is by no means done and the book will continue to 
be improved.

If you spot any issues, please let us know
via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/PredictiveEcology.org/issues).
