Thank you once again to all who participated in the 
*Robust and nimble scientific workflows, using SpaDES* workshop in June 11-13, 
2024.

We ask all participants - regardless of how many sessions they attended -- to
fill out the exit survey below.

You answers are much needed, as they will help shape and improve future workshops.
