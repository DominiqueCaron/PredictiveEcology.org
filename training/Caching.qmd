# Introduction to Cache {#sec-caching}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
See [Barebones R script] for the code shown in this chapter
:::

The objective of a reproducible workflow is likely that the entire work
flow from raw data to publication, decision support, report writing,
presentation building etc., can be built and be reproducible anywhere,
on any computer and operating system, with any starting conditions, on
demand.

As part of a reproducible workflow, caching of function calls, code
chunks, and other elements of a project can be very valuable. Caching
allows a code writer to run all code regularly without "secretly"
skipping certain lines because they take too long to run. This has 2
benefits.

1.  Each line gets run regularly so when failures crop up, they are
    detected quickly and can be fixed when they are introduced.

2.  Running code "somewhere else" (different machine, person, operating
    system) will be more likely to work on an ongoing basis, i.e., it
    will help maintain a "reproducible" state.

These benefits allow code to be constantly in a state of functioning,
from start to finish, which lowers the effort "at the end" to make all
the work reproducible.

The `reproducible::Cache()` function is built to work with many R
functions, including *some* that are used for their side effects or that
use pointers (e.g., a `terra` `SpatRaster`) instead of regular R
objects.

## How to use `Cache`

The `Cache` function can be used with any function. A user can wrap it
around another function call, use the base pipe operator `|>` or specify
the function and function arguments as arguments to `Cache`. The
following calls are the same, and thus the 2nd and 3rd will result in
the identical output to the first:

```{r simpleFunctions}
#| cache: true

library(reproducible)
reproducible::Cache(rnorm(1))

rnorm(1) |>
  reproducible::Cache()

reproducible::Cache(rnorm,
                    n = 1)
```

See `?reproducible::Cache` for many more examples.

## When to use `Cache`

The most obvious case to use `Cache` is when the calculation is
expensive. For example, GIS operations are commonly time consuming. In
the example below, we will use `terra::project` three times, with
timings.

### From disk

```{r function-level}
# Data setup
library(terra)
tmpDir <- file.path(tempdir(), "reproducible_examples", "Cache")
dir.create(tmpDir, recursive = TRUE)

x <- y <- 2001
ras <- terra::rast(terra::ext(0, x, 0, y), vals = sample(1:(x*y)), res = 1)
terra::crs(ras) <- "+proj=lcc +lat_1=48 +lat_2=33 +lon_0=-100 +datum=WGS84"
newCRS <- "+init=epsg:4326" # A longlat crs

# Call slow operation: project
# No Cache
system.time(map1 <- terra::project(ras, newCRS)) # Warnings due to new PROJ

# With Cache -- a little slower the first time because saving to disk
system.time(map2 <- terra::project(ras, newCRS) |> Cache())

# faster the second time; improvement depends on size of object and time to run function
system.time(map3 <- terra::project(ras, newCRS) |> Cache())
```

In this example, the object `map3` gets cached, along with the *evaluation* of the 
function `terra::project` and its arguments (`ras` and `newCRS`). If
either the function or supplied arguments change, `Cache` repeats the 
operation and re-caches the output in a new cache entry.

### From disk and memory

We can set an option so that objects will also be saved to disk as
normal, but they will also be saved as RAM objects -- "memoising".

```{r memoise}
optOrig <- options("reproducible.useMemoise" = TRUE)
system.time(map4 <- terra::project(ras, newCRS) |> Cache())

system.time(map5 <- terra::project(ras, newCRS) |> Cache())
options(optOrig)
```

## Where does the cache live? {#sec-cachewhere}

By default, on a temporary folder which *does not* persist between R
sessions. To see where this folder is run:

```{r cachePathOpts}
options("reproducible.cachePath")
```

For a persisting cache, we should change to a permanent folder path.
This can be done by in two ways:

```{r cachePathWays}
#| eval: false
#| purl: false
Cache(rnorm(1), 
      cachePath = "~/SpaDES_book/cache")
options("reproducible.cachePath")   ## still the temporary directory


options("reproducible.cachePath" = "~/SpaDES_book/cache")
Cache(rnorm(1))
```

The second, using `options` sets the `cachePath` for *any* subsequent
`Cache` call.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
In a SpaDES workflow context, the cached directory can be set by passing
the `list(..., cachePath = <a_path>)`[^1] to the `paths` argument in
`setupProject`, `simInit` or `simInitAndSpaDES`.
:::

## Caching examples

### Basic cache use with tags

We can add tags to identify the Cache call.

```{r tags}
ranNumsA <- Cache(rnorm, 4, userTags = c("random number generator"))

showCache(userTags = "random number generator")
```

## Clean up cache

We can use either `clearCache`, `keepCache`, or `cc` to remove things
from the `Cache` database. `clearCache` removes everything that matches
the query. `keepCache` keeps everything that matches the query. `cc`
removes the most recent entry (i.e., it is a shorthand for a commonly
used option).

```{r keepCache}
# Two different funcxtions
a <- rnorm(1) |> Cache()
b <- runif(1) |> Cache()

# Clear only the first one
clearCache(userTags = "rnorm", ask = FALSE)
a2 <- rnorm(1) |> Cache()
b2 <- runif(1) |> Cache()

# b2 and b are still identical; a and a2 are not
a == a2 # FALSE
b == b2 # TRUE

# This time keep ONLY the rnorm
keepCache(userTags = "rnorm", ask = FALSE)
a3 <- rnorm(1) |> Cache()
b3 <- runif(1) |> Cache()

# b2 and b are still identical; a and a2 are not
a2 == a3 # TRUE
b2 == b3 # FALSE
```

## Nested Caching

Nested caching is when Caching of a function occurs inside an outer
function, which is itself cached. This is a critical element to working
within a reproducible work flow. Ideally, at all points in a development
cycle, it should be possible to get to any line of code starting from
the very initial steps, running through everything up to that point, in
less than a few seconds. If the workflow can be kept very fast like
this, it will be very likely to work at any point it is tested.

In the example here, we run an `outer` function that calls an `inner`
function. If we decide to change the `outer` function along the way, and
the `inner` function is unaffected, then we can still recover the cached
version of the `inner` call.

*Warning* this will not necessarily work the other way, i.e., if `inner`
is changed, we won't notice until we `clearCache` and rerun.

```{r nested}
# Make 2 functions
inner <- function(mean) {
  d <- 1
  Cache(rnorm(3, mean = mean))
}
outer <- function(n) {
  Cache(inner(0.1))
}

# Call outer function
Cache(outer(n = 2))

# Change outer function
outer <- function(n) {
  a <- 0.1
  Cache(inner(a))
}

# Still recovers inner 
Cache(outer(n = 2))

# BUT if we change the inner, it won't work
inner <- function(mean) {
  d <- 2                        # Changed d
  Cache(rnorm(3, mean = mean))
}
Cache(outer(n = 2))
```

## Best practices

In general, we have found that use of `Cache` to be beneficial when used
as following:

1.  Slow functions get cached. "Slow" can be "slower than using `Cache`"

2.  Regularly `clearCache(ask = FALSE)`, e.g., at the end of a day or
    week of work, then let it run.

Some of our team regularly add:

3.  If using SpaDES, use cache at the event level, if the event is
    non-stochastic

4.  Don't cache a `simInit` call -- instead implement internal caching
    in the modules and use event caching. See
    [`vignette(topic = "iii-cache", package = "SpaDES.core")`](https://rdrr.io/cran/SpaDES.core/f/vignettes/iii-cache.Rmd)
