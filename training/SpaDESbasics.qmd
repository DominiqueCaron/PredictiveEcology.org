# SpaDES 101 {#sec-spadesone}

The following chapters cover the basics of working with SpaDES.

We introduce fundamental pieces of SpaDES modules, like *events* and
*functions*, how to create simple modules and link them in simple
workflows, the "simulation" object – the `simList` – module metadata and
an introduction to caching mechanisms in SpaDES.
