# SpaDES 101 {#sec-spadesone}

The following chapters cover the basics of working with SpaDES.

We introduce fundamental pieces of SpaDES workflows, namely *modules*, *events* and
*functions*. We show how to create simple modules and link them in simple
workflows, the "simulation" object – the `simList` – module metadata and
an introduction to caching mechanisms in SpaDES.

By the end of this chapter you should understand how SpaDES 
modules are comprised of events that are automatically scheduled and run
by the `SpaDES.core::simInit` and `SpaDES.core::spades` functions 
(or `SpaDES.core::simInitAndSpades` which groups the previous two).

that are scheduled in a yearly or monthly sequence](assets/img/modulesEventsScheme.png)
