# Introduction {.unnumbered}

## The three big problems in applied ecology

Applied ecology -- the study of ecological systems that are affected by
humans activities -- can be seen as addressing these problems:

1.  **many species are declining or uncontrollably increasing**
2.  **many processes (like fire and food web dynamics) are changing**
3.  **most problems require trans-disciplinary solutions**

Alongside these problems, ecologists must grapple with new expectations
for how they do their work to inform these problems.

## The expectations

To address these problems in the 21st century, applied ecologists must
uphold standards of:

1.  **transparency** -- analyses must be able to be inspected,
    understood, and scrutinized by many eyes;
2.  **reproducibilty** -- analyses must be able to be reproduced by
    others and into the future;
3.  **nimbleness** -- analyses must be able to respond **quickly** to
    new data, new insights, new drivers, and new management needs;
4.  **forecasting** -- analyses must demonstrate that they are proving
    reliable insights into the future, not just the past;
5.  **validation** -- analyses must clearly demonstrate why they should
    be trusted and used;
6.  **broad participation** -- every step of a project must include
    knowledge and participation from outside the scientific community.

It can be very challenging to address each of these.

## PERFICT

This book is intended to show a way to show applied ecologists an
approach that we have developed using the SpaDES set of R packages. This
approach will allow ecologists to get towards a PERFICT approach
[@mcintire2022]. Briefly, PERFICT is:

-   **P**redict regularly from models thare are

-   **E**valuated,

-   **R**eusable,

-   **F**reely accessible, and

-   **I**nteroperable, and that are part of

-   **C**ontinuous workflows that are

-   **T**ested regularly

With this approach, we can better meet the expectations, and better
address the problems.

## SpaDES

SpaDES is a set of R packages that facilitate the process creating and
useing highly **modular** code that has **metadata** attached.

### Modularity

Modular code for ecological analyses has been long proposed
[@reynolds1997]. Modularity means that scripts can be broken up into
themes that bundled into meaningful chunks that can be easily moved,
swapped, replaced or scrapped easily. A nice example of this is
@barros2023 where a module was included or removed to identify the value
of "adding more complexity". One simple conclusion followed Occam's
Razor: simpler data and models predicted simpler characteristics of the
forest than the complex data and models. In other words, adding
complexity to a model made the model perform worse for some
characteristics.

### Metadata

Metadata in a SpaDES context includes identifying what data are
**expected** by a chunk of code and what data are **created** by a chunk
of code: the **inputs** and **outputs**. This forces an ecologist to
understand their code and it allows R to know how to connect this chunk
of code with others. It allows SpaDES to chain or weave together
modules.

### Methods vs. Results

Scientists have embraced the idea of modular code by creating and using
functions bundled into packages, e.g., R packages. This is analogous to
the **Methods** section: i.e., to describes how you will do something.
This has massively accelerated Ecology and other data sciences. However,
even if you know all the functions that a paper used, it doesn't create
the Results. *SpaDES modules can be thought of as the code needed to
make the **Results**.* In other words, SpaDES enables us to bundle the
actual code needed to recreate all the steps to make the Results.

### Nimbleness

When combined with **modularity** we can weave together new Results that
use *new data*, *updated data*, a *new module*, a *new study area*, a
*new visualization*, address *new stakeholder's needs* and more.

## Our challenge

With the limited training provided in this book, applied ecologists can
work towards creating PERFICT code. Embracing the transparency and
nimbleness it provides, we can pivot more rapidly to the current
management needs. When we are asked at the end of a 3 year project,
*"can we redo everything because we have a new stakeholder who feels
that our assumptions are wrong?"*, ***our answer can be "yes"***.
