# SpaDES workflows and projects

One of the advantages of `SpaDES` is that we can make simple "linear" workflows, 
but we can also make complex workflows *emerge* from the
combinations of modules (and of their events) being put together by a
user. SpaDES modules provide their own needed schedules, and the metadata
tells SpaDES how different modules fit together. Then when executed, events
within and across modules go in the correct order. Then if the group of modules 
changes, the workflow steps may also change.

In this section, we will start with the simplest case of 2 chunks in sequence, and 
we will advance to chain together many modules and rich project workflows with `SpaDES.project`.
