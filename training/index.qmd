# Preface {.unnumbered}

***This book is a work in progress. Please visit this again as chapters
are being added and modified.***

The approaches presented here use the **SpaDES** family of packages and
associated packages, like `reproducible` and `Require`, that we have
developed to face a variety of issues that we experienced during our own
journeys as modellers and, more generally, scientists.

Many of these issues we faced because most of us were ecologists by
training (not computer scientists, not engineers, etc.), who lacked a
strong programming foundation. So, we expect many who have other
backgrounds and maybe very strong programming skills to find this set of
solutions foreign and perhaps unnecessary, limited, or over-complicated
for many applications outside the realm of ecological sciences. We
certainly don't expect NASA scientists to overhaul their own workflows
and follow ours -- but feel free too and send us your feedback!

The scope, therefore, of this book is limited to the many ways that
data, and an understanding of those data achieved through models, can be
used for decision making, reproducibility of publications that come from
the work, etc. By working towards a set of standards for our data and
modeling workflows, our science can become more nimble. We can thus
pivot and update as issues come up.

We hope that many ecologists and those in related sciences (e.g.
forestry, wildlife management, etc.), academics or practitioners, can
appreciate the value of transforming their work into R^3^T, PERFICT, and
nimble workflows and find these solution useful. Mostly we hope that
those that work with ecosystems can embrace these tools to work
towards expanding the abilities of the community 
to become robust to any scrutiny we face.
