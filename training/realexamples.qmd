# "Real-world" examples of `SpaDES` workflows

This section will take you through several "real-world" examples that
use SpaDES to build and execute a workflow. By "real-world" we mean
workflows that use models that have been/are used in research or
application.

Because we will not explain each model or the SpaDES modules in detail,
we encourage learning more about these models from the sources noted in
the chapters.

In this section we assume that readers are familiar with SpaDES, namely
creating and using SpaDES modules. If not, we encourage going through
the chapters in [`SpaDES` 101](SpaDESbasics.qmd#section).
