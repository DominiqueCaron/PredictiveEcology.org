# SpaDES workflows and projects

One of the advantages of `SpaDES` is that workflows arise from the
combinations of modules (and of their events) being put together by a
user. Because SpaDES automatically chains, schedules and executes events
within and across modules, if the group of modules changes, so do the
workflow steps being executed.

When module developers make sure modules are able to obtain defaults
values for all their inputs and when many modules have inputs and
outputs in common, recombining modules to creating new workflows can
happen at relatively little cost for a user.

In this section, we will cover how to chain together many modules and
how to create entire project workflows with `SpaDES.project`.
