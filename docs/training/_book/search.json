    "text": "Preface\nThis book is a work in progress. Please visit this again as chapters are being added and modified.\nThe approaches presented here use the SpaDES family of packages and associated packages, like reproducible and Require, that we have developed to face a variety of issues that we experienced during our own journeys as modellers and, more generally, scientists.\nMany of these issues we faced because most of us were ecologists by training (not computer scientists, not engineers, etc.), who lacked a strong programming foundation. So, we expect many who have other backgrounds and maybe very strong programming skills to find this set of solutions foreign and perhaps unnecessary, limited, or over-complicated for many applications outside the realm of ecological sciences. We certainly don’t expect NASA scientists to overhaul their own workflows and follow ours – but feel free too and send us your feedback!\nThis book is therefore focused on the many ways that models and data, including the data generated through models, can be used for decision making, reproducibility of publications, and reused across different applications and modelling contexts, etc. By working towards a set of standards for our data and modeling workflows, our science can become more nimble. We can thus pivot and update as issues come up.\nWe hope that many ecologists and those in related sciences (e.g. forestry, wildlife management, etc.), academics or practitioners, can appreciate the value of aligning their work with the R3T1, PERFICT2 and nimbleness principles and find these solutions useful. Mostly we hope that those that work with ecosystems can embrace these tools to work towards expanding the abilities of the community to become robust to any scrutiny we face.",

    "text": "Modularity\nModular code for ecological analyses has been long proposed (Reynolds and Acock 1997). Modularity means that scripts can be broken up into themes that bundled into meaningful chunks that can be easily moved, swapped, replaced or scrapped easily. A nice example of this is Barros et al. (2023) where a module was included or removed to identify the value of “adding more complexity”. One simple conclusion followed Occam’s Razor: simpler data and models predicted simpler characteristics of the forest more accurately than the complex data and models. In other words, adding complexity to a model made the model perform worse for some characteristics.\n\n\nMetadata\nMetadata in a SpaDES context includes identifying what objects  are expected by a chunk of code and what objects are created by a chunk of code: the inputs and outputs. This forces a user to understand their code and its linkages, and it allows R to know how to connect this chunk of code with others. Importantly, it allows SpaDES to chain modules such that the workflow structure can be defined from the bottom-up, rather than top-down.\n\n\nNimbleness\nTogether SpaDES’s modularity, standardized structure and metatada, improve workflow nimbleness, where we can weave together new Results that use new data, updated data, a new module, a new study area, a new visualization, address new stakeholder’s needs and more.\n\nAren’t packages and functions sufficient?\nScientists have embraced the idea of modular code by creating and using functions, often bundled into packages, e.g., R packages. This is analogous to the Methods section of a journal paper: i.e., the methods (functions) describe how you will do something. The use of packages in this way has massively accelerated Ecology and other data sciences.\nHowever, even if you know all the functions that a paper used, this in itself is not sufficient to reproduce the Results. SpaDES modules can be thought of the recipe needed to make the Results. In other words, a SpaDES module enables a developer to bundle the functions in a specific order so that one can recreate the steps to make the Results. A user can then use the module directly, rather instead of trying to recreate the necessary sequence of functions.\n\n\n\nFunctions and modules as key tools to achieve workflow nimbleness. From McIntire et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nI use targets for my workflows. How does SpaDES differ?\ntargets is an R package (descendant of drake), very similar to GNU Make, that facilitates building data analyses pipelines.\nThere are two major differences between targets and the SpaDES approach:\n\ntargets is “top-down”, SpaDES is “bottom-up” – with targets, the workflow is entirely defined by the script developer (as in Make). That is, they define the connections and the sequence between each “target” (the code sections that call functions and execute operations), when they will be iterated and for “how many times”. Re-arranging “targets” sequences and iterations may therefore be hard, if the “target” code is not well known/understood.\nSpaDES is meant to enable mixing-and-matching different modules that share the same inputs/outputs easily – i.e. without having to have deep knowledge of the module code. SpaDES will read each module’s metadata and from it deduce the sequence in which modules need to be chained. SpaDES will also iterate module code when necessary, following the developer’s “scheduling” instructions. The workflow sequence, therefore, arises from the set of modules that is being used1.\nSpaDES has “embedded” metadata – or at least it makes the developer think about it2. Each module is defined by listing not only the inputs and outputs, but also their descriptions and types of object class, the module’s description, its operating time scale, package and module dependencies, and much more. Some of the metadata is essential to chain modules (lists of inputs and outputs), some is not but can greatly facilitate workflow setup (e.g. declaring module dependencies), while other metadata is simply good to have (e.g. a description of the module).\n\nFinally, both targets and SpaDES have embedded caching mechanisms, which in SpaDES can be controlled at several levels (by the user, inside the module code, etc.) – see 10  Introduction to Cache on SpaDES caching mechanisms.",

    "text": "SpaDES & applied ecology\nSpaDES development was, and continues to be, strongly motivated by our attempts to answer important issues in applied ecology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three big problems in applied ecology\n\n\n\nApplied ecology – the application of ecological science to questions related to the effects of human activities on ecosystems – is challenged and motivated by three main problems:\n\nmany species are declining or uncontrollably increasing\nmany ecological processes (like fire, food web dynamics, productivity) are changing\nconservation and management problems require trans-disciplinary solutions\n\n\n\nAlongside these problems, ecologists must grapple with new expectations for how they do their work to inform these problems.\n\nNew expectations\nApplied ecologists of the 21st century are expected more and more to uphold standards of nimbleness, broad participation and scrutiny.\nAnalyses must be able to respond quickly to new data, new insights, new drivers, and new management needs; projects must include knowledge and participation from outside the scientific community and be relevant to non-scientific audiences; and they must accept and embrace scientific and non-scientific scrutiny.\nThese expectations are not independent of each other. Greater nimbleness allows for easier participation by others and scrutiny benefits from the participation of a broad range of specialists and non-specialists.\nMeeting these expectations requires the R3T:\n\nrepeatability – analyses must be able to produce the same results, when using the exact same context (e.g. same user, same machine setup);\nreproducibility – analyses must be able to produce the same results by others and into the future;\nreusability – the methodology must be easy to transfer and expand in a different context;\ntransparency – analyses must be able to be inspected, understood, and scrutinized by many eyes;\n\nbut also\n\nforecasting – analyses must demonstrate that they are proving reliable insights into the future, not just the past or theoretical expectation;\nvalidation – analyses must clearly demonstrate why they should be trusted and used;\nopen-data/open-models – raw data, parameters, model algorithms have to be (freely) accessible as much as possible;\ntesting – models and predictions should be continuously tested.\n\nTogether these 10 requirements (and a little more) are encompassed by the PERFICT principles for applied ecological modelling (McIntire et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPERFICT\n\n\n\n\nPredict regularly from models that are\nEvaluated,\nReusable,\nFreely accessible, and\nInteroperable, and that are part of\nContinuous workflows that are\nTested regularly\n\n\n\nIt can be very challenging to fulfill these expectations, especially for non-programmers.\nSpaDES aims to help (applied) ecologists “get there” by relieving ecologists from needing to know/learn advanced computer programming (e.g. developing caching mechanisms) and offering tools that will enable them to develop PERFICT workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt does so by harnessing the flexibility of R, the contributions of its vast community and knowing what tools applied ecologists (and modellers) often need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1: reproducible::prepInputs a tool that will make your life easier\n\n\n\nApplied ecologists often need to get a raw spatial layer from somewhere (locally, a data repository), make it conform to a given study area and even change it to a given spatial projection or resolution.\nThey also often need to do this for many layers.\nreproducible::prepInputs facilitates this process in a single function call by having the ability to:\n\ndownload from a data repository URL;\nspatially process the data according to a polygon or raster template\n\nIt also caches these operations, so that they don’t need to be repeated unnecessarily.\nThis can save hours of learning to master caching and GIS algorithms (or avoid using flawed approaches) for many ecologists!\n\n\nThe SpaDES set of R packages is full of tools like prepInputs (Tip 1).\nThis book is intended to show applied ecologists (and whoever else!) the approaches that we use to bring our work closer to the PERFICT principles, better meet the expectations, and better address the problems.",

    "text": "3.2 Can’t install a package\n\n3.2.1 Package has already been loaded\nSome packages have files that cannot be deleted if they are being used in the current or another R session. This is primarily true for packages with compiled code. This will create several cascading problems, even after restarting the current R session.\n\n3.2.1.1 Potential solutions\n\nRestart R – The number one solution for many problems is to restart R. If using RStudio, the keyboard shortcut is commonly CTRL-SHIFT-F10.\nClose other R or RStudio sessions – If you have more than one session open, each one may have packages loaded. That means you can’t install (update), delete or uninstall a package that has already been loaded elsewhere.\nClose RStudio and install in a separate R session – By default, RStudio pre-loads packages before user input. This is convenient under some conditions, but is very difficult to deal with when it doesn’t work correctly – e.g. when these packages need to be updated. You may have to close RStudio, open a separate R session (without RStudio) and install the packages there.\nUpdate packages in user library – Package versions may collide between the user library and the project library. Try to update the packages in the user library. To determine where this is, you can try:\nuserLib &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_USER\")\nthen update the packages there:\nupdate.packages(userLib, ask = FALSE)\nTurn off R diagnostics – Alternatively (or in complement) to the solution above, you can turn off R code diagnostics (temporarily or permanently), in your RStudio’s Global Options. This can greatly reduce the number of pre-loaded packages at the expense of losing some RStudio functionality. Via RStudio GUI:\n\n\nGo to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Code\n\nOpen the Diagnostics tab, and uncheck “Show diagnostics for R”\n\nRestart R after doing the above. Try the package installations again. If they fail again, see other solutions and try them.\n\n\n\nTurning of R diagnostics with RStudio – a potential solution to prevent RStudio from pre-loading several R packages.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can:\n\n\nCode\ninstall.packages(\"RStudio.prefs\")\nRStudio.prefs::use_RStudio_prefs(\nshow_diagnostics_r = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\nTurn off previous R session reloading – If R is reloading a previously saved session (loading an .Rdata file) this may also be loading the packages attached to this previous session. You can turn off this feature off (temporarily or permanently), in your RStudio’s Global Options. Via the RStudio GUI:\n\nGo to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; General and uncheck “Restore .RData into workspace at startup:`\n\n\n\n\nTurning of restoring previous R session with RStudio – a potential solution to prevent R from loading R packages used in a previous session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 00LOCK folder issues\nOnce a package installation failure happened and interrupted the process, there may be a 00LOCK folder that R cannot remove, nor overwrite. R can’t install anything until that 00LOCK folder is removed.\n\n3.2.2.1 Potential solutions\n\nDelete 00LOCK folder(s) – The error message of the package installation failure will indicate if this is the issue and tell you where the 00LOCK folder is located. Make sure all other R sessions are closed and that the current session is restarted (and possibly closed), before deleting the 00LOCK folder. Then try installing the package again. If you can’t delete it, ensure RStudio and R are completely closed and possibly other software such as Git version control software (e.g. GitKraken, Bitbucket).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Missing dependencies\nAlthough this happens less and less because functions like install.packages now default to installing package dependencies, it can still happen that one of the target package’s dependencies is missing or failed to install. The error message will indicate which one, but bear in mind that when installing many packages/dependencies, the reason why the dependency wasn’t installed may be buried in previous messages and warnings. So read the installation output carefully.\n\n3.2.3.1 Potential solutions\nThe solution will depend on the reason why the dependency package failed to install. See solutions in Package has already been loaded and 00LOCK folder issues.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Package version cannot be met or found\nWhen Require is used to install packages1, it uses various caching mechanisms. If a package can’t be found, or there is an unexplainable installation failure clearing the package cache may fix it.\n\n3.2.4.1 Potential solutions\nTry purging the cache with one or more of these:\n\n\nCode\n## Can't find the package remotely\nRequire::purgeCache()\n\n## Can't install a particular package, e.g., ggplot2\nRequire::clearRequirePackageCache(packages = \"ggplot2\")\n\n## The above didn't work, clear ALL packages from local cache\nRequire::purgeCache(packages = TRUE)",

For windows, it is something like:\n\n\n\nCode\n&gt; Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_USER\") [1] \"C:\\\\Users\\\\emcintir\\\\AppData\\\\Local/R/win-library/4.4\"}\n\n\nFor Linux, it is something like:\n\n\nCode\n&gt; Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_USER\") [1] \"/home/emcintir/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.3\"}\n\n\nIf you have a project-specific library, including if you use SpaDES.project or renv, .libPaths() will point to somewhere else. For SpaDES.project it will be something like:\n\n\nCode\n# Windows \n&gt; .libPaths() [1] \"C:/Users/emcintir/AppData/Roaming/R/data/R/SpaDES.project/packages/x86_64-w64-mingw32/4.4\"  \n\n# Linux \n&gt; .libPaths() [1] \"/home/emcintir/.local/share/R/SpaDES.project/packages/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.3\"}\n\n\nWhen you install a package, ensure it was installed in the correct location.\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Package loaded in RAM collides with package on disk\nIf you previously loaded a package via e.g., library(ggplot2), then you happen to update it to a newer version, the newer version will be on disk in your library, but packageVersion(\"ggplot2\") will show the older one.

A module must always have an “init” event. This is the only code that is “definitely run” in a module.\n\n\nCode\nRequire::Require(c(\"reproducible\", \"SpaDES.core (&gt;= 2.1.5)\"), \n                 repos = c(\"https://predictiveecology.r-universe.dev\", getOption(\"repos\")))\n\n# make a module\nmodulePath &lt;- \"~/SpaDES_book/NewModuleIntro/NewModule\"\nSpaDES.core::newModule(name = \"My_linear_model\", \n                       path = modulePath, \n                       open = FALSE,\n                       events = list(\n                         init = {\n                           x &lt;- rnorm(10)\n                           y &lt;- x + rnorm(10)\n                           # fit a linear model\n                           model &lt;- lm(y ~ x)\n                         }\n                       ))\n\n\nYou may get a warning related with the testthat R package not being available. This is fine.1\nKeeping objects\nFor now, we just say, if you want to keep an object, assign it to “sim”. We will explain this in much more detail later. Here, we want to keep the model that we fit. But we don’t care about the x and y. So we assign the model to sim.\n\n\nCode\n# make a module\nSpaDES.core::newModule(name = \"My_linear_model\", \n                       path = modulePath, open = FALSE,\n                       events = list(\n                         init = {\n                           x &lt;- rnorm(10)\n                           y &lt;- x + rnorm(10)\n                           # fit a linear model\n                           sim$model &lt;- lm(y ~ x)     #  &lt;--------- change to sim$\n                         }\n                       ))\n\n\nHow would we run this “init” event? We use simInit, which parses the code (like loading a library or sourcing a function) then spades, which executes it.\n\n\nCode\nout &lt;- simInit(modules = \"My_linear_model\", \n               paths = list(modulePath = modulePath))\nout &lt;- spades(out)\n\n\nWe can look at the output:\n\n\nCode\nout$model\n\n\nWe can also look at “what ran”… or in other words, what was our workflow. Of course, this will just be one “user-created” event (there are 4 “SpaDES-created” events … we may use them later, ignore for now)\n\n\nCode\ncompleted(out)\n\n\nWe have our first “simple workflow”! 1 chunk of code :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsimInit() before spades()\n\n\n\nSpaDES.core::simInit() always has to be called before SpaDES.core::spades().\nsimInit() will initialise the workflow simList object that spades() uses to execute the workflow.\nSee Chapter 7 for more detail about the simList\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Add a second module\nOur next step is to divide the pieces into conceptual chunks. Let’s now create a new module for the plot … a “visualization module”.\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::newModule(\"visualize\", path = modulePath, open = FALSE,\n                       events = list(\n                         init = {\n                           plot(sim$model)\n                         }\n                       )\n)\n\n\nAnd now we run both together. We name them both in the module argument. We are using simInitAndSpades which is a shortcut to running the two functions separately.\n\n\nCode\nout2 &lt;- simInitAndSpades(module = c(\"My_linear_model\", \"visualize\"), \n                         paths = list(modulePath = modulePath))\n\n\nWe can look at the output again:\n\n\nCode\nout2$model\n\ncompleted(out2)\n\n\nThis time, there is an extra event that happened. We now have a workflow of 2 events.",

This makes it clear that the metadata do not specify which they will go get; rather, it makes it clear that it doesn’t matter where the inputs are coming from. They could come from one of three sources: a user, another module, or defaults that the developer sets up. Likewise, the module specifies which outputs it creates, without specifying “for what other module”.\nThe inputs to this chunk are just one: the object x. This code will not work (i.e., it will cause an error) if x is not defined. We can say that this code chunk “expects” x as an input.\nThe outputs are y and model. We can say that this code chunk “creates” y and model as outputs. However, we had said in Chapter 4 that we would only be interested in keeping model. So, we will continue with only one output, model.\n\n\n5.2.2 Required Packages\nNext, what are the package dependencies?. We call this reqdPkgs in the SpaDES metadata. We see that there are three functions: rnorm, lm and plot. We don’t know what packages they are in, so we can find out by typing them at the R prompt. At the bottom of the function, it says that the function rnorm is in the stats package. Fortunately for us, this is a default (“base”) package in R and it is always pre-loaded. So, nothing to do here.\n\n\nCode\n&gt; rnorm function (n, mean = 0, sd = 1)  ... \n&lt;environment: namespace:stats&gt;}\n\n\nSo, our expectations, creations and dependencies are:\n\nInputs: x\nOutputs: model\nPackage dependencies: Base packages only\n\nWe will next put them into the correct places in the new SpaDES module.",

In the previous chapter, we didn’t look or care where the module code was.\nnewModule actually creates a new folder, with the name as provided by the argument, in the folder specified with path. This folder has several files in it. See ?newModule for details. For now, run the above and open the My_linear_model.R script that it creates.\nWhen we make a module, we get a message stating where the module code is. From here, open the file, e.g., by copy-pasting the file path (pick the .R file NOT the .Rmd file for now).\nYou can also set newModule(..., open = TRUE) to have RStudio open the .R and .Rmd files automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening a module file\nFrom here onward, we will need to manually open the module code file.\nEvery SpaDES module is defined by having at least 1 file that is named with &lt;modulePath&gt;/&lt;moduleName&gt;/&lt;moduleName&gt;.R. Even though we can do a lot with newModule(), we will need to get used to opening, examining and changing the code in the module code file.\n\n\n\nWe will look at a few elements on the module R script in this chapter.",

    "text": "5.7 Sharing inputs and outputs\nYou may have noticed that the init event is now placed into a function called doEvent.My_linear_model.init and it has an argument sim. If you are familiar with making functions in R, this is just a named argument \"sim\". This means that we can use sim inside the function. We don’t know what sim is yet, and we don’t know how to use it fully yet. But we do know that we have added sim$ to the init event. We also see that there is a return(sim) added at the bottom of the event function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn event occurs in a special function that starts with doEvent.. But, since it is “in a function”, each event has all the features of a function:\n\narguments – specifically sim can be used\nsomething returned – in this case, the simList. return(sim) must always be present - it is by default, but don’t delete it!\nit can be run– but don’t worry about running it; SpaDES runs it when it is time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simList\nThe simList is the data structure that is the foundation of SpaDES. It can be used like a list; accessing objects can be done with $ or [[\"object_name\"]], for example, and objects are manipulated as they would normally – e.g. if DF is a data.frame one would use sim$DF[1, 3] to extract the value on the first row and third column.\nIn any function that has an argument sim, we pass the simList, so we can access it with sim$ from inside such a function.\nSee Chapter 7 for more details about the simList.\n\n\n\nTo share objects between modules, we must assign them to the sim and make sure that return(sim) is at the end of the function.\nNow we have a module that creates one object, model and puts them inside sim. This all happens in the event called init.\nNext: add the visualization module with metadata",

    "text": "5.12 Common mistakes\nSome common mistakes/bugs that module developers encounter:\n\nObject doesn’t exist/is NULL. Errors like the ones below are usually the result of not providing default values for an input in the simList (via .inputObjects()), the user/another module not providing values for that object, or forgetting to assign an object to the simList (i.e. sim$y &lt;- &lt;...&gt;) See Chapter 6.\n\nError in model.frame.default(formula = y ~ sim$x, drop.unused.levels = TRUE) : \ninvalid type (NULL) for variable 'sim$x'\n\nError in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'y' not found\n\nParsing errors. These happen when simInit has issues reading the module R script (or other associated scripts) and are usually easy to debug by reading the error message. For instance, the one below indicates that lines 43, 44, have a problem, which is a missing comma after the “)”.\n\nError in parse(filename) : \nC:&lt;modulePath&gt;/My_linear_model/My_linear_model.R:44:3: unexpected symbol\n43:   )\n44:   outputObjects\n^\n\nEnvironment- and simList-related error. If the simList (sim) is not returned at the end of a function that takes it as an argument – e.g. an event function, the .inputObjects() function… – it will either be lost or changed into something unexpected. Below are two examples of errors that may announce this problem.\n\nError in &lt;...&gt;\nsim must be a simList\n\nError in as.environment(pos) : invalid 'pos' argument",

Remember to save the file after you’re done.\n\n\nCode\ndefineModule(\n  &lt;...&gt;\n    parameters = bindrows(\n      # here\n      &lt;...&gt;\n    )\n  &lt;...&gt;\n)\n\n\nNow run the the module:\n\n\nCode\nout2 &lt;- SpaDES.core::simInitAndSpades(modules = \"My_linear_model\",\n                                      paths = list(modulePath = modulePath))\nparams(out2)   # can you find the length parameter?\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 .inputObjects\nFor every Input that is specified in the metadata, the module developer has the option of specifying a default. In R, functions can be given defaults when they are defined like this:\n\n\nCode\nrnormMean5 &lt;- function(n = 1) { # the n = 1 is the default value\n  rnorm(n = n, mean = 5)\n}\nrnormMean5() # can be run without any arguments\n\n\n[1] 6.893804\n\n\nThis works for only the simplest cases. In the case of a module, objects can be arbitrarily complicated and so this approach will not be suitable.\nInstead, there is a function that is called every time a module is initialized (i.e. by simInit()) where a developer can put anything they want to specify as defaults. It is generally most useful to use if (!SpaDES.core::suppliedElsewhere(\"obj\", sim)) i.e., if the object isn’t in sim, then give it a value.\n\n\nCode\n.inputObjects &lt;- function(sim) {\n  \n  if (!suppliedElsewhere(\"y\", sim)) {\n    sim$y &lt;- rnorm(100)\n  }\n  \n  return(invisible(sim))\n}\n\n\n\n6.1.2.1 Advanced .inputObjects example\nIn the Biomass_core module (this is an implementation of the LANDIS-II Biomass Succession Extension v3.2), there are many Inputs as defined in the metadata. The module needs each one of these to work.\nThe developers have created a .inputObjects function that will fill in these Inputs with defaults if the user hasn’t supplied them (using !SpaDES.core::suppliedElsewhere()).\nWe will look at a few examples in this module: Biomass_core::.inputObjects.\n\nsome GIS tests that evaluate whether 2 objects are in the same CRS (i.e., they need to be the same projection, etc., for this module to work)\nif an object is missing, it may make sense to fill in the details with parameters from the Internet.\nan object called studyArea.

If the answer is “yes”, then perhaps expanding the existing module is the way to go.\nCan we foresee that swapping between algorithms/approaches will be desired in the future? E.g., knowing that an ordinary least square regression could, in the future, be swapped by a mixed effects model to compare model performance – i.e. both approaches are valid and we want eventually to have both. If the answer is “yes”, then creating a new module will allow greater flexibility in the future.\n\nWe usually see “data preparation” and “model calibration” steps as semi-independent from “prediction/simulation steps” and have typically created “data preparation”/“calibration” modules to keep these steps separate, and to allow swapping between different approaches to preparing inputs for a model.",

Modules define events (doEvent.*moduleName*), events call specific functions (we some times call the main function an event calls an “event function”, but there can be other nested functions within these), and functions can be defined within modules, R packages, or user code contained in .R scripts inside the module’s R/ folder.\nWe would not define functions in the .GlobalEnv.\n\n8.3.1 Adding functions\nAny function can be written and defined in any .R file in the R folder, just like an R package. They can also be placed in the main module script (the one named &lt;moduleName&gt;.R). The default template includes several functions.\nIn this example, instead of writing the code that does what we want inside the doEvent function itself, lets use the Init function. We move the code from the “init” event into a function, then call that function.\n\n\nCode\ndoEvent.My_linear_model.init &lt;- function(sim, eventTime, eventType, priority) {\n  sim &lt;- Init(sim)\n  return(invisible(sim))\n}\n\nInit &lt;- function(sim) {\n  y &lt;- sim$x + rnorm(10)\n  sim$model &lt;- lm(y ~ sim$x)\n  return(invisible(sim))\n}\n\n\nWe can extend this to any number of functions. Notice, that functions can have any arguments. They don’t have to have sim. The critical point to retain is that the doEvent function must return sim. We can also write documentation using roxygen2 tags (though converting this to normal R documentation is still experimental within a SpaDES module).\nCopy these three functions to your module, replacing the existing functions with these ones (for doEvent.My_linear_model.init and Init). generateY is completely new, so it won’t replace anything.\n\n\nCode\ndoEvent.My_linear_model.init &lt;- function(sim, eventTime, eventType, priority) {\n  sim &lt;- Init(sim)\n  return(invisible(sim))\n}\n\n# Use this inside the `doEvent.My_linear_model.init` function\nInit &lt;- function(sim) {\n  y &lt;- generateY(sim$x)\n  sim$model &lt;- lm(y ~ sim$x)\n  return(invisible(sim))\n}\n\n#' A function that generates random error around an `x`\n#' \n#' @param x Any numeric vector of length 10 \ngenerateY &lt;- function(x) {\n  x + rnorm(10)\n}",

    "text": "8.4 Module types\nSpaDES doesn’t have explicit module types. Rather, by convention, we associate different modules with generic things they do. A fairly comprehensive list of modules types that we create are below. We will revisit this later in [Part 3](ContinuousWorkflows.qmd). \n\n8.4.1 Static\nStatic modules can be defined as modules that “run once”. This means that they may have only one event. Or a sequence of events that occur one after the other with no rescheduling.\nThese could include:\n\nData preparation modules - one (maybe just the “init” event) or few events and their primary goal is to get and deal with data;\nGIS modules that do a number of GIS operations to get data into the necessary formats;\nData Visualization modules that specialize in creating a set of visuals from a known set of inputs.\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Dynamic\nDynamic modules are modules that have events that recur. There are at least 2 types of such models: those that have cyclic dependencies, i.e., its outputs are also its inputs (possibly with other modules in between) and those that do not.\n\nLandscape simulation modules (e.g., wildfire, vegetation change)\nWildlife population modules with Markov dependency (e.g., population matrix models)\nWildlife population modules without Markov-dependency (e.g., population models that only depend on habitat covariates)\nData visualization modules that get used e.g., annually after other modules.\n\nIn Barros et al. (2023) we classified modules with respect to what the modules try to accomplish:\n\n“data/calibration modules” prepare model inputs and parameters\n“prediction/simulation modules” generate predictions using either static or dynamic mechanisms\n“validation modules” evaluate predictions against independent data.\n\nThere are no strict rules to classify a SpaDES module, just as there are no strict rules to classify an R script.",

SpaDES calls this function several times and executes it’s code depending on the values of the eventTime and eventType arguments.\nBy default the only mandatory event executed by spades is the init1, unless we specifically tell it to do more, using the SpaDES.core::scheduleEvent() function and declaring more values for the event argument (i.e. more events).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder of event code (not to confuse with event execution)\n\n\n\nEvents do not have to be defined in any particular order in the doEvent.&lt;module_name&gt;() function, as their order of execution is solely determined by scheduling (scheduleEvent()) or, for some events, imposed by simInit() and spades() (e.g., .inputObjects() and init are always executed first).\nSimilarly, the order in which functions used by events appear in the module R script is arbitrary.\n\n\nscheduleEvent() is the “scheduler” function. Using the arguments eventTime and eventType, we define when and what event to schedule, respectively. eventPriority can be specified to determine which event should occur first, when two are scheduled for the same time2. Finally, moduleName and sim always have to be passed.\nWe place scheduleEvent() anywhere we want inside each event’s code in doEvent.*(). In this example, we will place it in a few places:\n\n9.3.1.1 In the init event\nWe look at the init event (code inside event = \"init\") and we see 2 scheduleEvent calls that come with the template. We will use those to learn. In each “event”, we often see one part that “does something” and another part that “schedules something”.\nIn the default template, we “do” the Init function and we schedule plot and save. We can delete the save event, as we won’t do that here. But we will replace it with “schedule prediction”.\nSee ?start, ?scheduleEvent, ?P\n\n\nCode\nsim &lt;- Init(sim)\n\n# schedule future event(s)\nsim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, P(sim)$.plotInitialTime, \"scheduling\", \"plot\")\n\n# here we create a new event type == \"predictions\" and we schedule it for `start(sim)`\nsim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, start(sim), \"scheduling\", \"predictions\") \n\n\nCopy the above code chunk to the init section so that it looks like this:\n\n\nCode\nswitch(\n  eventType,\n  init = {\n    sim &lt;- Init(sim)\n    \n    # schedule future event(s)\n    sim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, P(sim)$.plotInitialTime, \"scheduling\", \"plot\")\n    \n    # here we create a new event type == \"predictions\" and we schedule it for `start(sim)`\n    sim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, start(sim), \"scheduling\", \"predictions\") \n  },\n  ...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatch scheduleEvent() arguments to event names\n\n\n\nThe name of an event is defined as argument values for doEvent.&lt;module_name&gt;(..., eventType):\n\n\nCode\ndoEvent.scheduling = function(sim, eventTime, eventType) {\n  switch(\n    eventType,\n    init = {    # &lt;----- \"init\" is the eventType/name\n      &lt;...&gt;\n    },\n    predictions = {  # &lt;----- \"predictions\" is another eventType/name\n      &lt;...&gt;\n    },\n    warning(noEventWarning(sim))\n  )\n  return(invisible(sim))\n}\n\n\nIt must match what is provided to scheduleEvent(..., eventType).\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 The new events\nWe will add code to make two new events, called \"predictions\" and \"plot\" (the name must match what we wrote in the scheduleEvent() above). In these events, we “do” the prediction, schedule the next prediction at “time plus 1”, and plot.\nSee ?SpaDES.core::times().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime in SpaDES\n\n\n\nIt is useful to understand time in SpaDES. Time has units (e.g., “year”) which is defined by the modules metadata timeunit. So, if time(sim) is 1 or 2024, that would be in year units, if the module is in year. To know what “time” it is in a module, the easiest function is time(sim). That will give you the “time”.\nTime, in SpaDES, is a way of ordering events. If one event happens at time 2024, and another event happens at 2025, then the 2024 event will happen first.\nThe other two useful functions are start(sim) and end(sim), which will give you the starting time of the spades call and ending time respectfully. These would have been specified in simInit.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nswitch(\n  eventType,\n  init = {...},\n  predictions = {\n    # do the Prediction\n    sim &lt;- Prediction(sim)\n    \n    # schedule the next Prediction\n    sim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 1, \"scheduling\", \"predictions\") \n  },\n  plot = {\n    # do the plot\n    sim &lt;- plotFun(sim)\n  },\n  ...\n)\n\n\nBecause the \"predictions\" event schedules itself we will have to adapt the Prediction() function, as the for-loop is no longer necessary:\n\n\nCode\nPrediction &lt;- function(sim) {\n  \n  sim$pred[[time(sim)]] &lt;- predict(sim$out, newdata = data.frame(y = rnorm(10) + time(sim)))\n  \n  return(invisible(sim))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop-down vs Bottom-up workflow sequencing\n\n\n\nIn a “top-down” workflow, we could imagine something like:\n\n\nCode\nscheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 1, \"predictions\")\nscheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 2, \"predictions\")\nscheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 3, \"predictions\")\n\n\nThis would schedule 3 predictions, during the next three “time steps”. This may be very clear, but it would be difficult to do this for dozens of years (could be done with a for-loop).\nA “bottom up” approach is to schedule the predictions event once during init, then each time that predictions event occurs, reschedule it:\n\n\nCode\ninit = {\n  ...\n  scheduleEvent(sim, start(sim), \"predictions\")   # schedule first occurrence of \"predictions\"\n},\npredictions = {\n  ...\n  scheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 1, \"predictions\")  # re-schedule \"predictions\"\n}\n\n\nEach time the predictions event happens, it will reschedule itself forever! Very simple. The workflow sequence emerges from the self-scheduling.\n\n\n\n\n9.3.3 Double check existing events\nIf we ran the above changes, we would see an error because plotFun was scheduled to run at the time that is specified by .plotInitialTime, which by default is start(sim). We have no data yet at that time. So, we will choose to schedule plotFun to run at end(sim):\n\n\nCode\nscheduleEvent(sim, end(sim), \"scheduling\", \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents and event functions – not to be confused\n\n\n\nThe name of an event and of the function that an event calls (the “event function”) need not (and should not, to avoid confusion) be the same.\nIn the examples above the predictions event called the Prediction() event function and the plot event called the plotFun() function.\nConventionally, event names have been all lowercase; but this highly depends on developer coding style and the module.",

If either the function or supplied arguments change, Cache repeats the operation and re-caches the output in a new cache entry.\n\n\n10.2.2 From disk and memory\nWe can set an option so that objects will also be saved to disk as normal, but they will also be saved as RAM objects – “memoising”.\n\n\nCode\noptOrig &lt;- options(\"reproducible.useMemoise\" = TRUE)\nsystem.time(map4 &lt;- terra::project(ras, newCRS) |&gt; Cache())\n\n\n   user  system elapsed \n   0.55    0.04    0.59 \n\n\nCode\nsystem.time(map5 &lt;- terra::project(ras, newCRS) |&gt; Cache())\n\n\n   user  system elapsed \n   0.06    0.03    0.10 \n\n\nCode\noptions(optOrig)",

    "text": "10.6 Nested Caching\nNested caching is when Caching of a function occurs inside an outer function, which is itself cached. This is a critical element to working within a reproducible work flow. Ideally, at all points in a development cycle, it should be possible to get to any line of code starting from the very initial steps, running through everything up to that point, in less than a few seconds. If the workflow can be kept very fast like this, it will be very likely to work at any point it is tested.\nIn the example here, we run an outer function that calls an inner function. If we decide to change the outer function along the way, and the inner function is unaffected, then we can still recover the cached version of the inner call.\nWarning this will not necessarily work the other way, i.e., if inner is changed, we won’t notice until we clearCache and rerun.\n\n\nCode\n# Make 2 functions\ninner &lt;- function(mean) {\n  d &lt;- 1\n  Cache(rnorm(3, mean = mean))\n}\nouter &lt;- function(n) {\n  Cache(inner(0.1))\n}\n\n# Call outer function\nCache(outer(n = 2))\n\n\n[1]  0.6758975  0.3360315 -0.3005881\nattr(,\".Cache\")\nattr(,\".Cache\")$newCache\n[1] TRUE\n\nattr(,\"tags\")\n[1] \"cacheId:aa5fa876944e27be\"\nattr(,\"call\")\n[1] \"\"\n\n\nCode\n# Change outer function\nouter &lt;- function(n) {\n  a &lt;- 0.1\n  Cache(inner(a))\n}\n\n# Still recovers inner \nCache(outer(n = 2))\n\n\n[1]  0.6758975  0.3360315 -0.3005881\nattr(,\".Cache\")\nattr(,\".Cache\")$newCache\n[1] TRUE\n\nattr(,\"tags\")\n[1] \"cacheId:293cb55e4c25d110\"\nattr(,\"call\")\n[1] \"\"\n\n\nCode\n# BUT if we change the inner, it won't work\ninner &lt;- function(mean) {\n  d &lt;- 2                        # Changed d\n  Cache(rnorm(3, mean = mean))\n}\nCache(outer(n = 2))\n\n\n[1]  0.6758975  0.3360315 -0.3005881\nattr(,\".Cache\")\nattr(,\".Cache\")$newCache\n[1] FALSE\n\nattr(,\"tags\")\n[1] \"cacheId:293cb55e4c25d110\"\nattr(,\"call\")\n[1] \"\"",

This means that the slow, two-or-more-stage processes of downloading, custom operations, and possibly GIS using `to functions can all be Cached in a single step, resulting in the smallest possible output being saved, i.e., intermediate large objects have only limited “saving”.\nNOTE: Rmarkdown and Quarto both have a form of caching of chunks. This can be effective in some circumstances, but it is somewhat limited (as are all forms of Caching – they will hit their limits somewhere). For instance, they do not deal with the pointers of C++ objects in terra.",

    "text": "12.4 A note on testing SpaDES modules\nModule testing can happen at several levels:\n\nAssertions – tests/checks embedded in module code.\nUnit tests of module functions - individual functions are tested independently of the module.\nSolo-module testing - the module is tested alone with default and non-default input/parameter values.\nIntegration tests - the module is tested in a workflow with other modules, using alone with default and non-default input/parameter values.\n\nAt a minimum, a developer should put in place assertions. These are small checks and tests inserted in the module code that issue meaningful warnings/error messages to users when they fail. Here’s an example of an assertion:\n\n\nCode\nmyFunction &lt;- function(x, ...) {\n  if (!inherits(x, c(\"numeric\", \"integer\"))) {\n    stop(\"x should be a numeric/integer vector\")\n  }\n  mean(x, ...)\n}\n\nmyFunction(LETTERS[1:10])\n# Error in myFunction(LETTERS[1:10]) : x should be a numeric/integer vector\n\n\nUnit tests require “pulling out” the functions in the module and, potentially, testing them in separate testing workflows.\nIntegration tests are implicitly done when modules are put together for particular projects, but this will only cover a specific set of input/parameter values and conditions. Therefore, it is ideal to also do solo-module testing and integration tests that capture a range of module setup conditions.\nThis is time-consuming work, but does pay off in the long-run especially if tests are repeated on a regular basis. For this reason, SpaDES.core::newModule() creates a tests/ folder in the module folder as a reminder to the developer that they should eventually develop tests for their modules.",

Here we left the defaults for all paths (see ?setupPaths() for the list of path options) except for the project location (projectPath) and the location of the package library (packagePath, which will be placed inside projectPath).\noptions. We also set a couple of “global options” that determine the where data will be downloaded to (“reproducible.destinationPath”). This will be the same as the default directory to look for inputs (“spades.inputPath”). Notice how we used paths$ to get these directory paths from the paths object that setupProject creates (based on the paths argument above) prior to setting the options.\nother arguments (...). Almost all other arguments in the call above were part of the ... (in the setupProject function). These are objects that are objects that are used by modules. Because modules have defaults for most objects, these tend to be “optionaly”; but the more a user understands a module, the more clearly the defaults can be evaluated as to whether they are sufficient or not. To avoid creating objects in the .GlobalEnv first, we take advantage of setupProject‘s ability to run the code in { } and make these polygons. Note that these arguments are passed prior to any ’formal arguments’ (see ?formalArgs())\nThere are 4 objects that tend to be “required” in the modules that have emerged from the Predictive Ecology group. These are about the spatial area to be covered by the project: e.g. studyArea, studyAreaLarge, rasterToMatch and rasterToMatchLarge. or whose defaults we want to override (e.g., the species table, sppEquiv, and trait values, speciesParams).",

Let’s assume you initialised and ran your simulation with two separate simInit2() and spades() calls.\nInspect module connections and between-module object flows:\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::moduleDiagram(simInitOut)\nSpaDES.core::objectDiagram(simInitOut)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLandR vegetation module ‘connections’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject flows between modules (truncated).\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the scheduling of the init events in simInitOut and how simOut has future events scheduled too – thanks to this, we can extend the simulation beyond the original SpaDES.core::end(sim) of 2031 (Extend the simulation).\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::events(simInitOut)\nSpaDES.core::events(simOut)\n\n\nWe can also have a look at the completed events:\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::completed(simInitOut)\nSpaDES.core::completed(simOut)\n\n\nFinally, the following accessor functions will show a list of model inputs, outputs and parameters:\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::inputs(simOut)\nSpaDES.core::outputs(simOut)\nSpaDES.core::parameters(simOut)\n\n\nWe could even plot some of the input and output rasters to check that they are as we expected – no need to look for these objects files, they are all in the simList.\n\n\nCode\n# spatial inputs from list above\nterra::plot(simOut$studyAreaLarge, col = \"navyblue\", main = \"studyArea & studyAreaLarge\")\nterra::plot(simOut$studyArea, col = \"lightblue\", add = TRUE)\n\n# spatial outputs from list above\nterra::plot(simOut$vegTypeMap, \n            col = hcl.colors(palette = \"Dynamic\", n = length(unique(simOut$vegTypeMap[]))), \n            main = \"\", add = TRUE)\nterra::plot(simOut$speciesLayers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy areas used for parameterisation (dark blue) and simulation (light blue).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year’s vegetation type map (leading species).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent cover of species retained for simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspecting inputs and outputs directly from the simList\n\n\n\nMore importantly in our view, is the ability to inspect statistical models used to fit model parameters. This is possible because the developers have declared the fitted statistical model objects as module outputs. Often, this type of information is buried in supplementary materials of papers and incomplete (e.g. coefficients and goodness-of-fit statistics are presented, but the entire model object, with its fitted values, residuals, etc., are not).\nBy exporting entire model objects, and making them available via repeatable code or data repositories, model transparency and potential scrutiny are massively increased.\n\n\nCode\n# model used to estimate species establishment probabilities\nsummary(simOut$modelBiomass$mod)\nplot(simOut$modelBiomass$mod)\n\n# model used to calibrate Picea glauca's growth parameters\nsummary(simOut$speciesGrowthCurves$Pice_Gla$NonLinearModel$Pice_Gla)\n\n\n\n\n14.3.2 Turn plotting on after setting up the workflow\nWe can change parameters and re-run the simulation to, e.g., activate live plotting in Biomass_core, without having to\n\nchange the parameter provided to setupProject\nrepeat the setupProject call\n\nNote that because simOut has some objects that have “pointers”, like SpatRaster objects that come from tif files, we may not be able to start from the previous simInitOut. In other words, even though it looks like it is the object that emerges from the simInit function and therefore, we should be able to pass it to spades, it may not work as desired (can test this, if desired). This means that simInitOut may need to re-generated, otherwise spades would inherit some objects that were changed during the previous spades.\nThanks to internal caching, it will only take seconds to “redo” simInitOut. You will also notice that init events are retrieved from cache, this time around2.\n\n\nCode\nsimInitOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::simInit2(out)\nSpaDES.core::P(simInitOut, param = \".plots\", module = \"Biomass_core\") &lt;- \"screen\"\nSpaDES.core::P(simInitOut, param = \".plotMaps\", module = \"Biomass_core\") &lt;- TRUE\nsimOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::spades(simInitOut)\n\n\n\n\n14.3.3 Extend the simulation\nWe can also keep it going for a few more years. Use SpaDES.core::end() to extend the simulation another 20 years and then call SpaDES.core::spades() on the changed simList (not the one output by `SpaDES.core::simInit2()) to resume the simulation from 2031.\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::end(simOut) &lt;- 2061\nsimOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::spades(simOut)\n\n\n\n\n14.3.4 Many replicates (somewhat experimental; actively developing)\nDynamic ecological models like LandR often simulate stochastic ecological processes, like dispersal, probability of germination, or fire spread (see Chapter 15), which requires replicating simulations. The number of replicates will largely depend on the variability generated by the model. The more variability, the more replicates needed.\nThe set of LandR modules used here generates little variation in tree species dynamics and 10 replicates are sufficient.\nWe use SpaDES.experiment::experiment2() to do two things:\n\nCreate a folder structure by replicate to store the simulation outputs\nGenerate 2 independent simulations and run them in sequence (Listing 14.1) or in parallel (Listing 14.2), using the future package.\n\n\n\n\n\nListing 14.1: Sequential replication\n\n\nRequire::Install(\"SpaDES.experiment (HEAD)\", repos = unique(repos))\nsimInitOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::simInit2(out)\n\nfuture::plan(\"sequential\")\nsimOutExperiment &lt;- SpaDES.experiment::experiment2(simInitOut, replicates = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3.4.1 Parallel\nThis works, in theory, on Windows, Linux and MacOS, but in practice seems to be less problematic on Linux.\n\n\n\n\nListing 14.2: Parallel replication\n\n\nfuture::plan(\"multisession\", workers = 2)\nsimOutExperiment &lt;- SpaDES.experiment::experiment2(simInitOut, replicates = 2)\nfuture:::ClusterRegistry(\"stop\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependence between replicates\n\n\n\nIn general, there are two levels of replicate independence that can be considered in dynamic ecological models like LandR, where stocahstic processes happen during the parameterisation phase[^3] and during the simulation phase:\n\nreplicates may have independent parameterisation and initialisation and independent ecological process simulation\nreplicates may share the parameterisation and initialisation but have independent ecological process simulation.\n\nNeither is better than the other and the one to chose depends on the questions and hypotheses being asked.\nIn the example above, replicates share the same parameters/initial conditions because they all access the same cached objects from the init events – scroll up to see printed outputs from experiment2().\nTo have fully independent replication we can use experiment2(..., useCache = FALSE)",

    "text": "16.1 spadesCBM Modules\nFour modules need to be run in tandem for a spadesCBM simulation (see Setup\nfor how these relate in SpaDES). The first module CBM_defaults reads in defaults CBM parameters for Canada. The second module CBM_dataPrep_SK is a data preparation SpaDES module, where input data and spatial layers are assembled and prepared for a specific study area (the SK indicates the specific study area or scenario, in this example it is a small raster in Saskatchewan). In spadesCBM, as in CBM, growth curves are the main change-agent. The third module CBM_vol2biomass translates user-provided growth curves (\\(m^3/ha\\)) into increments for specific above ground carbon pools (metric tonnes of carbon/ha) using Boudewyn et al. (2007) models to which we added a smoothing algorithm. These three modules provide the inputs to the CBM_core module where processes are applied on a yearly time step. This modularity enables users to access and change default parameters, change inputs, and assess the impact of these changes. We are working on some implementations of this modularity and making these available to the community. We hope others will do the same. A manual describing spadesCBM in detail is forthcoming. The link to the manual will be posted here.\nSeveral core utilities to spadesCBM are provided by the CBMutils package, available on GitHub. Active development in CBMutils and all spadesCBM modules is underway.",

It defines what is saved in the output folder. You can also see a list of these outputs your simulation has created, their name, and where they were saved by using the outputs() function like so:\n\n\nCode\n&gt; outputs(simPython)\n\n  objectName saveTime                                                                      file     \n1   cbmPools     1998 ~/spadesCBMpython/outputs/cbmPools_year1998.rds saveRDS    base  TRUE\n2        NPP     1998      ~/spadesCBMpython/outputs/NPP_year1998.rds saveRDS    base  TRUE\n3   cbmPools     1999 ~/spadesCBMpython/outputs/cbmPools_year1999.rds saveRDS    base  TRUE\n4        NPP     1999      ~/spadesCBMpython/outputs/NPP_year1999.rds saveRDS    base  TRUE\n5   cbmPools     2000 ~/spadesCBMpython/outputs/cbmPools_year2000.rds saveRDS    base  TRUE\n6        NPP     2000      ~/spadesCBMpython/outputs/NPP_year2000.rds saveRDS    base  TRUE\n\n\nIn our simulation, as defined in setupProject() with out$outputs, we have cbmPools.rds and NPP.rds files for each simulation year. These files are in the outputs folder created in the project directory defined in our Setup. You can look at the these if you would like to explore results.\n\n\n16.4.2 Plotting\nWe can also visualize some results using some plotting functions sourced from our modules.\n\n\nCode\ncarbonOutPlot(\n  emissionsProducts = simPython$emissionsProducts\n  ) # This plots yearly forest products and yearly emissions for the length of the simulation\n\n barPlot(\n   cbmPools = simPython$cbmPools\n   ) # This plots the carbon proportions above and below ground each simulation year\n\nNPPplot(\n  spatialDT = simPython$spatialDT,\n  NPP = simPython$NPP,\n  masterRaster = simPython$masterRaster\n  ) # This plots the per-pixel average net primary production \n\nspatialPlot(\n  cbmPools = simPython$cbmPools,\n  years = 2000,\n  masterRaster = simPython$masterRaster,\n  spatialDT = simPython$spatialDT\n  ) # this plots the Total Carbon per pixel for the final simulation year\n\n\nYou can also schedule these plots in your simulation. To do that a plot event has to be scheduled within a module. We want the plots to be automatically generated at the end of the simulation. In the CBM_core.R module, we already have a plot event defined in the doEvent.CBM_core() function.\n\n\nCode\nplot = {\n      if (time(sim) != start(sim)) {\n        retry(quote({\n          carbonOutPlot(\n            emissionsProducts = sim$emissionsProducts\n          )\n        }), retries = 2)\n\n        barPlot(\n          cbmPools = sim$cbmPools\n        )\n\n        NPPplot(\n          spatialDT = sim$spatialDT,\n          NPP = sim$NPP,\n          masterRaster = sim$masterRaster\n        )\n      }\n\n      spatialPlot(\n        cbmPools = sim$cbmPools,\n        years = time(sim),\n        masterRaster = sim$masterRaster,\n        spatialDT = sim$spatialDT\n      )\n    }\n\n\nEven though the event (plot) exists, we had not scheduled this event in the simulation you just ran. If you look a few lines above where the plots are defined in the module (on line 186 in the CBM_core.R module), you will find a line of code currently commented out. If this line was being read, this would schedule the plotting event at the very end of the simulation (i.e., eventPriority = 12).\n\n\nCode\n# sim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, end(sim), \"CBM_core\", \"plot\",  eventPriority = 12)\n\n\nYou can remove the comment # to add this line of code back in, save CBM_core.R, and rerun your simulation. The plotting is now a scheduled event in this module. The model will now automatically run the plotting functions above.",

Remember: other users will need to install the same software and be able to the same jumps/operations that you did without you looking over their shoulder.\nModularise and “functionise” – avoid loooooong scripts, which are harder to read, learn and debug. Instead bundle your code into modules and functions.\n\nSpaDES helps the modularisation part a great deal but it is still up to the developer to create functions and to decide what workflow components can/should be broken into separate modules or events.\nWhen using embedded module and event caching, think about what workflow steps can be cached to speed up development and re-runs and consider turning these into separate modules or events.\nConsider “packaging” your functions so they can be used across projects and SpaDES modules.\n\n\n\nFunctions and modules as key tools for $R^3T$, but also for building integrated and continuous workflows; McIntire et al. (2022)\n\n\n\nCentralize workflow in a single script – this is quite intuitive when using SpaDES, as usually there is a “controller” script that sets up and runs the workflow.\nUse project-oriented and self-contained workflows – pick a structure that is self-explanatory and make sure that the project can be “moved” between users/machines without changing the code.\nDon’t use absolute paths – use relative paths (relative to project directory) – RStudio Projects and SpaDES.project do this automatically.\n\nYou can even install your R packages into project-level libraries, to allow for different package versions between projects in the same machine\n\nVersion control – great for collaboration, great for tracking changes, great to recover old versions of a project/code\n\nWhen using version control software, it might be best not to use cloud-based storage and syncing (e.g. OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) on the same files/folders, as it can conflict with and slow down the version control software.\n\nTest (!) – test your code and your workflow if you want them to endure and persist through time and users\n\nUse a combination of assertions, unit tests and integration tests1",

    "text": "Best practices for SpaDES workflows\n\nLimit the number of objects in .GlobalEnv – instead, put them in functions or inside a module. When objects are in modules, you can add default object values (e.g. via .inputObjects()), or save them into files that are loaded by setupProject or simInit. Alternatively, you can pass objects or code to make them directly to setupProject() as ... arguments, or to the simInit objects arguments. See 6  Providing Module Inputs and, for an example with setupProject, 14  Forest Landscape Modelling with LandR and setupProject.\n\nWhy? Because modules might then find/use objects in/from the .GlobalEnv when they shouldn’t (they should use them from the simList). SpaDES.project::setupProject and simInit deal with these issues by loading and objects directly into a separate environment (the simList).\n\nDon’t install packages “manually” and “separately” – script package installation in a reproducible way, i.e. that includes reference to package versions. Even better, let setupProject deal with package installation.\n\nWhy not? When you have many modules, each with a list of packages it needs it will be hard to figure out what packages need to be installed or updated. setupProject was designed to deal with this issue using the Require package.\n\nDon’t pre-load packages – let simInit do it when the simulation is being initialized and only after it has asserted that packages are available and in the correct versions.\n\nWhy not? There are many reasons why things can get messed up with modelling in R… e.g., package dependency issues (especially version numbers that collide during development stages), internet availability. Pre-loading a package prevents it from being updated, which can make setupProject (and simInit) fail if they attempt to update a package to respect module requirements.\n\nAvoid installing packages into a cloud-synced/managed folder – files in and folders managed by cloud-storage software like OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox, are constantly being screened by these software which can lead to conflicts during package installation (e.g., the software holds on to certain files and R is unable to delete and re-install them). If package installation is scripted, there is no need to sync it with a server – you can recover it at any time.\nAvoid pointing the cache to a cloud-synced/managed folder – for the same reasons as in the previous point.",
