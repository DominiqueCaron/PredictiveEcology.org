    "text": "Preface\nThis book is a work in progress. Please visit this again as chapters are being added and modified.\nThe approaches presented here use the SpaDES family of packages and associated packages, like reproducible and Require, that we have developed to face a variety of issues that we experienced during our own journeys as modellers and, more generally, scientists.\nMany of these issues we faced because most of us were ecologists by training (not computer scientists, not engineers, etc.), who lacked a strong programming foundation. So, we expect many who have other backgrounds and maybe very strong programming skills to find this set of solutions foreign and perhaps unnecessary, limited, or over-complicated for many applications outside the realm of ecological sciences. We certainly don’t expect NASA scientists to overhaul their own workflows and follow ours – but feel free too and send us your feedback!\nThe scope, therefore, of this book is limited to the many ways that data, and an understanding of those data achieved through models, can be used for decision making, reproducibility of publications that come from the work, etc. By working towards a set of standards for our data and modeling workflows, our science can become more nimble. We can thus pivot and update as issues come up.\nWe hope that many ecologists and those in related sciences (e.g. forestry, wildlife management, etc.), academics or practitioners, can appreciate the value of transforming their work into R3T, PERFICT, and nimble workflows and find these solution useful. Mostly we hope that those that work with ecosystems can embrace these tools to work towards expanding the abilities of the community to become robust to any scrutiny we face.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the various contributors, SpaDES developers and SpaDES users that continue to make the open-source ecosystem of SpaDES modules grow.\nWe also thank the Quarto team for their great work.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Modularity\nModular code for ecological analyses has been long proposed (Reynolds and Acock 1997). Modularity means that scripts can be broken up into themes that bundled into meaningful chunks that can be easily moved, swapped, replaced or scrapped easily. A nice example of this is Barros et al. (2023) where a module was included or removed to identify the value of “adding more complexity”. One simple conclusion followed Occam’s Razor: simpler data and models predicted simpler characteristics of the forest than the complex data and models. In other words, adding complexity to a model made the model perform worse for some characteristics.\n\n\n1.1.2 Metadata\nMetadata in a SpaDES context includes identifying what objects  are expected by a chunk of code and what objects are created by a chunk of code: the inputs and outputs. This forces a user to understand their code and its linkages, and it allows R to know how to connect this chunk of code with others. Importantly, it allows SpaDES to chain modules such that the workflow structure can be defined from the bottom-up, rather than top-down.\n\n\n1.1.3 Nimbleness\nTogether SpaDES’s modularity, standardized structure and metatada, improve workflow nimbleness, where we can weave together new Results that use new data, updated data, a new module, a new study area, a new visualization, address new stakeholder’s needs and more.\n\n1.1.3.1 Aren’t packages and functions sufficient?\nScientists have embraced the idea of modular code by creating and using functions, often bundled into packages, e.g., R packages. This is analogous to the Methods section of a journal paper: i.e., the methods (functions) describe how you will do something. The use of packages in this way has massively accelerated Ecology and other data sciences.\nHowever, even if you know all the functions that a paper used, this in itself is not sufficient to reproduce the Results. SpaDES modules can be thought of the recipe needed to make the Results. In other words, a SpaDES module enables a developer to bundle the functions in a specific order so that one can recreate the steps to make the Results. A user can then use the module directly, rather instead of trying to recreate the necessary sequence of functions.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 I use targets for my workflows. How does SpaDES differ?\nThere are two major differences between targets and the SpaDES approach:\n\ntargets is “top-down”, SpaDES is “bottom-up” – with targets, the workflow is entirely defined by the script developer (as in Make). This is, they define the connections and the sequence between each “target” (the code sections that call functions and execute operations), when they will be iterated and for “how many times”. Re-arranging “targets” sequences and iterations may therefore be hard, if the “target” code is not well known/understood.\nSpaDES is meant to enable mixing-and-matching different modules that share the same inputs/outputs easily – i.e. without having to have deep knowledge of the module code. SpaDES will read each module’s metadata and from it deduce the sequence in which modules need to be chained. SpaDES will also iterate module code when necessary, following the developer’s “scheduling” instructions. The workflow sequence, therefore, arises from the set of modules that is being used1.\nSpaDES has “embedded” metadata – or at least it makes the developer think about it2. Each module is defined by not only listing the inputs and outputs, but also their descriptions and types of object class, the module’s description, it’s operating time scale and what packages and other modules it depends on, and much more. Some of the metadata is essential to chain modules (lists of inputs and outputs), other isn’t, but can greatly facilitate workflow setup (e.g. declaring module dependencies), while other metadata are simply good to have (e.g. a description of the module).\n\nFinally, both targets and SpaDES have embedded caching mechanisms, which in SpaDES can be controlled at several levels (by the user, inside the module code, etc.) – see Chapter 11 on SpaDES caching mechanisms.",

    "section": "1.2 SpaDES & applied ecology",
    "text": "1.2 SpaDES & applied ecology\nSpaDES development was, and continues to be, strongly motivated by our attempts to answer important issues in applied ecology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three big problems in applied ecology\n\n\n\nApplied ecology – the application of ecological science to questions related to the effects of human activities on ecosystems – is challenged and motivated by three main problems:\n\nmany species are declining or uncontrollably increasing\nmany ecological processes (like fire, food web dynamics, productivity) are changing\nconservation and management problems require trans-disciplinary solutions\n\n\n\nAlongside these problems, ecologists must grapple with new expectations for how they do their work to inform these problems.\n\n1.2.1 New expectations\nApplied ecologists of the 21st century must uphold standards of:\n\ntransparency – analyses must be able to be inspected, understood, and scrutinized by many eyes;\nreproducibility – analyses must be able to be reproduced by others and into the future;\nnimbleness – analyses must be able to respond quickly to new data, new insights, new drivers, and new management needs;\nforecasting – analyses must demonstrate that they are proving reliable insights into the future, not just the past or theoretical expectation;\nvalidation – analyses must clearly demonstrate why they should be trusted and used;\nbroad participation – projects must include knowledge and participation from outside the scientific community and be relevant to non-scientific audiences.\n\nIt can be very challenging to fulfil these expectations. SpaDES aims to help (applied) ecologists “get there” by facilitating the application of the PERFICT principles for applied ecological modelling (McIntire et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPERFICT\n\n\n\n\nPredict regularly from models thare are\nEvaluated,\nReusable,\nFreely accessible, and\nInteroperable, and that are part of\nContinuous workflows that are\nTested regularly\n\n\n\nSpaDES intends to relieve ecologists from needing to know/learn advanced computer programming (e.g. developing caching mechanisms) to profit from tools that will enable them to develop PERFICT workflows.\nIt does so by harnessing the flexibility of R, the contributions of its vast community and knowing what tools applied ecologists (and modellers) often need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1.1: reproducible::prepInputs will make your life easier\n\n\n\nApplied ecologists often need to get a raw spatial layer from somewhere (locally, a data repository), make it conform to a given study area and even change it to a given spatial projection or resolution.\nThey also often need to do this for many layers.\nreproducible::prepInputs facilitates this process in a single function call by having the ability to:\n\ndownload from a data repository URL;\nspatially process the data according to a polygon or raster template\n\nIt also caches these operations, so taht they don’t need to be repeated unecessarily.\nThis can save hours of learning to master caching and GIS algorithms (or avoid using flawed approaches) for many ecologists!\n\n\nThe SpaDES set of R packages is full of tools like prepInputs (Tip 1.1).\nThis book is intended to show applied ecologists (and whoever else!) the approaches that we use to bring our work closer to the PERFICT principles, better meet the expectations, and better address the problems.",

    "text": "4.2 Can’t install a package\n\n4.2.1 Package has already been loaded\nSome packages have files that cannot be deleted if they are being used in the current or another R session. This is primarily true for packages with compiled code. This will create several cascading problems, even after restarting the current R session.\n\n4.2.1.1 Potential solutions\n\nRestart R – The number one solution for many problems is to restart R. If using RStudio, the keyboard shortcut is commonly CTRL-SHIFT-F10.\nClose other R or RStudio sessions – If you have more than one session open, each one may have packages loaded. That means you can’t install (update), delete or uninstall a package that has already been loaded elsewhere.\nClose RStudio and install in a separate R session – By default, RStudio pre-loads packages before user input. This is convenient under some conditions, but is very difficult to deal with when it doesn’t work correctly – e.g. when these packages need to be updated. You may have to close RStudio, open a separate R session (without RStudio) and install the packages there.\nUpdate packages in user library – Package versions may collide between the user library and the project library. Try to update the packages in the user library. To determine where this is, you can try:\n\nuserLib &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_USER\")\nthen update the packages there:\nupdate.packages(userLib, ask = FALSE)\n\nTurn off R diagnostics – Alternatively (or in complement) to the solution above, you can turn off R code diagnostics (temporarily or permanently), in your RStudio’s Global Options. This can greatly reduce the number of pre-loaded packages at the expense of losing some RStudio functionality. Via RStudio GUI:\n\n\nGo to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Code\nOpen the Diagnostics tab, and uncheck “Show diagnostics for R”\n\nRestart R after doing the above. Try the package installations again. If they fail again, see other solutions and try them.\n\n\n\nTurning of R diagnostics with RStudio – a potential solution to prevent RStudio from pre-loading several R packages.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can:\n\n\nCode\ninstall.packages(\"RStudio.prefs\")\nRStudio.prefs::use_RStudio_prefs(\n  show_diagnostics_r = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 00LOCK folder issues\nOnce a package installation failure happened and interrupted the process, there may be a 00LOCK folder that R cannot remove, nor overwrite. R can’t install anything until that 00LOCK folder is removed.\n\n4.2.2.1 Potential solutions\n\nDelete 00LOCK folder(s) – The error message of the package installation failure will indicate if this is the issue and tell you where the 00LOCK folder is located. Make sure all other R sessions are closed and that the current session is restarted (and possibly closed), before deleting the 00LOCK folder. Then try installing the package again. If you can’t delete it, ensure RStudio and R are completely closed and possibly other software such as Git version control software (e.g. GitKraken, Bitbucket).\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Missing dependencies\nAlthough this happens less and less because functions like install.packages now default to installing package dependencies, it can still happen that one of the target package’s dependencies is missing or failed to install. The error message will indicate which one, but bear in mind that when installing many packages/dependencies the reason why the dependency wasn’t installed may be burried in previous messages and warnings. So read the installation output carefully.\n\n4.2.3.1 Potential solutions\nThe solution will depend on the reason why the dependency package failed to install. See solutions in Package has already been loaded and 00LOCK folder issues.\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Package version cannot be met or found\nWhen Require is used to install packages1, it uses various caching mechanisms. If a package can’t be found, or there is an unexplainable installation failure clearing the package cache may fix it.\n\n4.2.4.1 Potential solutions\nTry purging the cache with one or more of these:\n\n\nCode\n## Can't find the package remotely\nRequire::purgeCache()\n\n## Can't install a particular package, e.g., ggplot2\nRequire::clearRequirePackageCache(packages = \"ggplot2\")\n\n## The above didn't work, clear ALL packages from local cache\nRequire::purgeCache(packages = TRUE)",

A module must always have an “init” event. This is the only code that is “definitely run” in a module.\n\n\nCode\nRequire::Require(c(\"reproducible\", \"SpaDES.core (&gt;= 2.1.5)\"), \n                 repos = c(\"https://predictiveecology.r-universe.dev\", getOption(\"repos\")))\n\n# make a module\nnm1 &lt;- \"My_linear_model\"\nmodulePath &lt;- \"~/SpaDES_book/NewModuleIntro/NewModule\"\nnewModule(name = nm1, path = modulePath, open = FALSE,\n          events = list(\n            init = {\n              x &lt;- rnorm(10)\n              y &lt;- x + rnorm(10)\n              # fit a linear model\n              model &lt;- lm(y ~ x)\n            }\n          ))\n\n\nKeeping objects\nFor now, we just say, if you want to keep an object, assign it to “sim”. We will explain this in much more detail later. Here, we want to keep the model that we fit. But we don’t care about the x and y. So we assign the model to sim.\n\n\nCode\n# make a module\nSpaDES.core::newModule(name = nm1, path = modulePath, open = FALSE,\n                       events = list(\n                         init = {\n                           x &lt;- rnorm(10)\n                           y &lt;- x + rnorm(10)\n                           # fit a linear model\n                           sim$model &lt;- lm(y ~ x)     #  &lt;--------- change to sim$\n                         }\n                       ))\n\n\nHow would we run this “init” event? We use simInit, which parses the code (like loading a library or sourcing a function) then spades which executes it.\n\n\nCode\nout &lt;- simInit(modules = nm1, paths = list(modulePath = modulePath))\nout &lt;- spades(out)\n\n\nWe can look at the output:\n\n\nCode\nout$model\n\n\nWe can also look at “what ran”… or in other words, what was our workflow. Of course, this will just be one “user” created event (there are 4 “SpaDES-created” events … we may use them later, ignore for now)\n\n\nCode\ncompleted(out)\n\n\nWe have our first “simple workflow”! 1 chunk of code :)\n\n5.2.1 Add a second module\nOur next step is to divide the pieces into conceptual chunks. Let’s now create a new module for the plot … a “visualization module”.\n\n\nCode\nnm2 &lt;- \"visualize\"\nnewModule(nm2, path = modulePath, open = FALSE,\n          events = list(\n            init = {\n              plot(sim$model)\n            }\n          )\n)\n\n\nAnd run both together. We name them both in the module argument. We are using simInitAndSpades which is a shortcut to running the two function separately.\n\n\nCode\nout2 &lt;- simInitAndSpades(module = c(nm1, nm2), paths = list(modulePath = modulePath))\n\n\nWe can look at the output again:\n\n\nCode\nout2$model\n\ncompleted(out2)\n\n\nThis time, there is an extra event that happened. We now have a workflow of 2 events.",

This makes it clear that the metadata do not specify which they will go get; rather, it makes it clear that it doesn’t matter where the inputs are coming from. They could come from one of three sources: a user, another module, or defaults that the developer sets up. Likewise, the module specifies which outputs it creates, without specifying “for what other module”.\nThe inputs to this chunk are just one: the object x. This code will not work (i.e., it will cause an error) if x is not defined. We can say that this code chunk “expects” x as an input.\nThe outputs are y and model. We can say that this code chunk “creates” y and model as outputs. However, we had said in the previous chapter Chapter 5 that we would only be interested in keeping model. So, we will continue with only one output, model.\n\n\n6.2.2 Required Packages\nNext, what are the package dependencies?. We call this reqdPkgs in the SpaDES metadtaa. We see that there are three functions: rnorm, lm and plot. We don’t know what packages they are in, so we can find out by typing them at the R prompt. At the bottom of the function, it says that the function rnorm is in the stats package. Fortunately for us, this is a default (“base”) package in R and it is always pre-loaded. So, nothing to do here.\n\n\nCode\n&gt; rnorm function (n, mean = 0, sd = 1)  ... \n&lt;environment: namespace:stats&gt;}\n\n\nSo, our expectations, dependencies and creations are:\n\nInputs: x\nOutputs: model\nPackage dependencies: Base packages only\n\nWe will next put them into the correct places in the new SpaDES module.",

This folder has several files in it. See ?newModule for details. For now, run the above and open the My_linear_model.R script that it creates.\nWhen we make a module, we get a message stating where the module code is. FROM HERE, OPEN THE FILE, e.g., by copy-paste the file path (pick the .R file NOT the .Rmd file for now)**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening a module file\nFrom here onward, we will need to actually manually open the module code file. Every SpaDES module is defined by having at least 1 file that is named with the &lt;modulePath&gt;/&lt;moduleName&gt;/&lt;moduleName&gt;.R. Even though we can do a lot from the newModule, we will need to get used to opening, examining and changing the code in the module code file.\n\n\n\nWe will look at a few elements in this chapter.",

We don’t know what sim is yet, and we don’t know how to use it fully yet. But we do know that we have added sim$ to the init event. We also see that there is a return(sim) added at the bottom of the event function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn event occurs in a special function that starts with doEvent.. But, since it is “in a function”, each event has all the features of a function:\n\narguments – specifically sim can be used\nreturn(sim) – must always be present.

It can be used like a list; accessing objects can be done with $ or [[\"model\"]], for example.\nIn any function that has an argument sim, we pass the simList, so we can access the simList with sim$ from inside such a function.\n\n\n\nTo share objects between modules, we must assign them to the sim and make sure that return(sim) is at the end of the function.\nNow we have a module that creates one object, model and puts them inside sim.

In the case of a module, objects can be arbitrarily complicated and so this approach will not be suitable.\nInstead, there is a function that is called every time a module is initialized (i.e. by simInit()) where a developer can put anything they want to specify as defaults.

The developer tests whether it exists and creates an error if it does not exist.\nSecond, some GIS tests that evaluate whether 2 objects are in the same CRS (i.e., they need to be the same projection, etc., for this module to work)\nThird, if an object is missing, it may make sense to fill in the details with parameters from the Internet.\n\n\n\n7.1.3 From another module\nWe will leave this section for the ?sec-manymodules chapter, where we are work with multiple modules.",

Modules define functions (doEvent.*moduleName*), events call specific functions (we some times call these “event functions”), and functions can be defined within modules, R packages, or user code.\n\n9.3.1 Rerun-tolerant functions\nIn re-usable workflows, functions become particularly effective if they are rerun-tolerant, see Tip 9.1 (we use tolerant in part to reflect the fact that the computer tolerates it but also the human because they don’t have to wait).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 9.1\n\n\n\nFunctions are rerun-tolerant if they\n\nare rerun-efficient, meaning the first time they run they “do” something, but the second and subsequent times, they give the same output as the first time, but they skip the “doing” part\n\n\noptionally the efficiency can be by memory caching (“memoising”) and/or more persistent disk caching.\n\n\nand are rerun-robust, meaning they can be run error-free and with sensible or identical outputs (if inputs are the same) using any person’s computer.\n\n\n\nTo achieve these qualities, functions must use some sort of caching (i.e., evaluate the call and skip the content of the function if the call is deemed identical to a previous version of the call), and they must address any computer or operating system issues (such as paths, package dependencies etc.).\nBase R has some functions that are like this and some that are not. For example library is rerun-tolerant because it does something the first time, which may be slow, and subsequent times in the same session it is fast (memory efficient, but not disk efficient)\nTwo key functions help achieve these points, ?reproducible::Cache and ?reproducible::prepInputs\n\n\n9.3.2 Cache()\nCache() is a function that can be wrapped around other functions that turns that function into a rerun-tolerant function. reproducible::Cache has several important modifications that work for some objects that don’t cache well using “normal” caching, such as terra objects that are actually pointers to locations on disk rather than normal R objects.\nThe following code will result in d being the same vector as b, and it will be returned quickly.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(reproducible)\n\na &lt;- rnorm(1e7)\nb &lt;- rnorm(1e7) |&gt; Cache()\nd &lt;- rnorm(1e7) |&gt; Cache()\n\n\nSee ?reproducible::Cache\n\n\n9.3.3 prepInputs()\nprepInputs() is a workhorse function that helps users point to cloud or local datasets: ?reproducible::prepInputs.\nIn this example, we point to a url only and prepInputs downloads it, does checksumming, unzips it and loads it into R using the default terra::vect because it is a shp file after the unzipping.\n\n\nCode\necozoneOfCanada &lt;- reproducible::prepInputs(\n  url = \"http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/nsdb/ecostrat/zone/ecozone_shp.zip\")\n\n\nFor more information ?reproducible::prepInputs",

    "text": "9.4 Module types\nEven though all modules are built with the same structures (events & functions), for convenience, we can categorize different types of modules in different ways.\nFor example, modules can be categorized by:\n\n9.4.1 Static\nStatic modules can be defined as modules that “run once”. This means that they may have only one event. Or a sequence of events that occur one after the other with no rescheduling.\nThese could include: - Data preparation modules; - one (maybe just the “init” event) or few events and their primary goal is to get and deal with data; - GIS modules that do a number of GIS operations to get data into the necessary formats; - Data Visualization modules that specialize in creating a set of visuals from a known set of inputs.\n\n\n9.4.2 Dynamic\nDynamic modules are modules that have events that recur. There are at least 2 types of such models: those that have cyclic dependencies, i.e., its outputs are also its inputs (possibly with other modules in between) and those that do not.\n\nlandscape simulation modules (e.g., wildfire, vegetation change)\nwildlife population modules with Markov dependency (e.g., population matrix models)\nwildlife population modules without Markov-dependency (e.g., population models that only depend on habitat covariates)\nData Visualization modules that get used e.g., annually after other modules.\n\nIn Barros et al. (2023) we classified modules with respect to what the modules try to accomplish:\n\n“data/calibration modules” prepare model inputs and parameters\n“prediction/simulation modules” generate predictions using either static or dynamic mechanisms\n“validation modules” evaluate predictions against independent data.\n\nThere are no strict rules to classify a SpaDES module, just as there are no strict rule classify an R script.",

    "text": "10.3 Scheduling\nNow we need to tell SpaDES when to do and when to iterate each of the steps or “events”. The Init we do once, at the start. The plotFn we do once, but this time it is at the “end”. The .inputObjects always only happens once and “before the start” (Init) – it is scheduled automatically so nothing to do here. The last part (i.e., the prediction event) must happen 10 times, and it must start after Init and before the plotFn.\n\n10.3.1 doEvent\nThere is a special function in a SpaDES module called doEvent(). SpaDES calls this function once, passing the argument event = \"init\". That means that R will enter into this function only once and run only the init part, unless we specifically tell it to do more, using the scheduleEvent function.\nWe place this function anywhere we want inside doEvent, in general. In this example, we will place it in a few places.\n\n10.3.1.1 In the init event\nWe look at the init event (code inside event = \"init\") and we see 2 scheduleEvent calls that come with the template. We will use those to learn. In each “event”, we often see one part that “does something” and another part that “schedules something”.\nIn the default template, we “do” the Init function and we schedule plot and save. We can delete the save event, as we won’t do that here. But we will replace it with “schedule prediction”.\nSee ?start, ?scheduleEventhttps://rdrr.io/cran/SpaDES.core/man/scheduleEvent.html, ?P\n\n\nCode\nsim &lt;- Init(sim)\n\n# schedule future event(s)\nsim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, P(sim)$.plotInitialTime, \"scheduling\", \"plot\")\n# sim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, P(sim)$.saveInitialTime, \"scheduling\", \"save\")\n\n# here we create a new event type == \"predictions\" and we schedule it for `start(sim)`\nsim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, start(sim), \"scheduling\", \"predictions\") \n\n\nCopy the above code chunk to the init section so that it looks like this:\n\n\nCode\nswitch(\n  eventType,\n  init = {\n    sim &lt;- Init(sim)\n    \n    # schedule future event(s)\n    sim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, P(sim)$.plotInitialTime, \"scheduling\", \"plot\")\n    \n    # here we create a new event type == \"predictions\" and we schedule it for `start(sim)`\n    sim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, start(sim), \"scheduling\", \"predictions\") \n  },\n  ...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.2 The new event\nWe add code to make a new event, called \"predictions\" (the name must match what we wrote in the scheduleEvent above). In this event, we “do” the prediction, then we schedule the next prediction at “time plus 1”\nSee ?SpaDES.core::times().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime in SpaDES\n\n\n\nIt is useful to understand time in SpaDES. Time has units (e.g., “year”) which is defined by the modules metadata timeunit. So, if time(sim) is 1 or 2024, that would be in year units, if the module is in year. To know what “time” it is in a module, the easiest function is time(sim). That will give you the “time”.\nTime, in SpaDES, is a way of ordering events. If one event happens at time 2024, and another event happens at 2025, then the 2024 event will happen first.\nThe other two useful functions are start(sim) and end(sim), which will give you the starting time of the spades call and ending time respectfully. These would have been specified in simInit.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nswitch(\n  eventType,\n  init = {...},\n  predictions = {\n    # do the Prediction\n    sim &lt;- Prediction(sim)\n    \n    # schedule the next Prediction\n    sim &lt;- scheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 1, \"scheduling\", \"predictions\") \n  },\n  ...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop-down vs Bottom-up workflow sequencing\n\n\n\nIn a “top-down” workflow, we could imagine something like:\n\n\nCode\nscheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 1, \"predictions\")\nscheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 2, \"predictions\")\nscheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 3, \"predictions\")\n\n\nThis would schedule 3 predictions, during the next three “time steps”. This may be very clear, but it would be difficult to do this for dozens of years (could be done with a for-loop).\nA “bottom up” approach is to schedule the predictions event once, then each time that predictions event occurs, reschedule it.\n\n\nCode\ninit = {\n  scheduleEvent(sim, time(sim), \"predictions\")\n}\n\npredictions = {\n  scheduleEvent(sim, time(sim) + 1, \"predictions\")\n}\n\n\nEach time the predictions event happens, it will reschedule itself forever! Very simple. The workflow sequence emerges from the self-scheduling.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Double check existing events\nIf we ran the above changes, we would see an error because plotFn is, by default, scheduled to run at the time that is specified by .plotInitialTime, which by default is start(sim).

So, we will choose to schedule plotFn to run at end(sim):\n\n\nCode\nscheduleEvent(sim, end(sim), \"scheduling\", \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n10.3.4 Update module metadata\nLike in Chapter 6, we have to update the module metadata… what the inputs, outputs, parameters are. SpaDES will not error if the metadata are not correct, but it will try to point out the problems.\nHere’s an example:\n\n\nCode\ncreatesOutput(objectName = \"predictions\", objectClass = \"data.frame\", \n              desc = \"Table of predictions and years\")",

This is a critical element to working within a reproducible work flow. Ideally, at all points in a development cycle, it should be possible to get to any line of code starting from the very initial steps, running through everything up to that point, in less than a few seconds. If the workflow can be kept very fast like this, it will be very likely to work at any point it is tested.\nIn the example here, we run an outer function that calls an inner function. If we decide to change the outer function along the way, and the inner function is unaffected, then we can still recover the cached version of the inner call.\nWarning this will not necessarily work the other way, i.e., if inner is changed, we won’t notice until we clearCache and rerun.\n\n\nCode\n# Make 2 functions\ninner &lt;- function(mean) {\n  d &lt;- 1\n  Cache(rnorm(3, mean = mean))\n}\nouter &lt;- function(n) {\n  Cache(inner(0.1))\n}\n\n# Call outer function\nCache(outer(n = 2))\n\n\n[1]  0.20387979 -0.55140572  0.01996051\nattr(,\".Cache\")\nattr(,\".Cache\")$newCache\n[1] TRUE\n\nattr(,\"tags\")\n[1] \"cacheId:aa5fa876944e27be\"\nattr(,\"call\")\n[1] \"\"\n\n\nCode\n# Change outer function\nouter &lt;- function(n) {\n  a &lt;- 0.1\n  Cache(inner(a))\n}\n\n# Still recovers inner \nCache(outer(n = 2))\n\n\n[1]  0.20387979 -0.55140572  0.01996051\nattr(,\".Cache\")\nattr(,\".Cache\")$newCache\n[1] TRUE\n\nattr(,\"tags\")\n[1] \"cacheId:293cb55e4c25d110\"\nattr(,\"call\")\n[1] \"\"\n\n\nCode\n# BUT if we change the inner, it won't work\ninner &lt;- function(mean) {\n  d &lt;- 2                        # Changed d\n  Cache(rnorm(3, mean = mean))\n}\nCache(outer(n = 2))\n\n\n[1]  0.20387979 -0.55140572  0.01996051\nattr(,\".Cache\")\nattr(,\".Cache\")$newCache\n[1] FALSE\n\nattr(,\"tags\")\n[1] \"cacheId:293cb55e4c25d110\"\nattr(,\"call\")\n[1] \"\"",

We also set a couple of “global options” that determine the where data will be downloaded to (“reproducible.destinationPath”). This will be the same as the default directory to look for inputs (“spades.inputPath”). Notice how we used paths$ to get these directory paths from the paths object that setupProject creates (based on the paths argument above) prior to setting the options.\nother arguments (...). Almost all other arguments in the call above were passed to .... These are objects that need to be supplied by the user for these modules (e.g. studyArea and studyAreaLarge) or whose defaults we want to override (e.g., the species table, sppEquiv, and trait values, speciesParams). To avoid creating them on the .GlobalEnv first, we take advantage of setupProject‘s ability to run the code in { } and make these polygons. Note that these arguments are passed prior to any ’formal arguments’ (see ?formalArgs())",

This module validates simulation outputs agains data and therefore can only be run after the simulation is complete.\nWe will initialize the simulation with SpaDES.core::simInit() so that we can use the same simList object in Section 15.3.2.\nPlease note that it may take over an hour to download all necessary raw data and fit model parameters.\n\n\nCode\n## initialise then run simulation \nsimInitOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::simInit2(out)\nsimOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::spades(simInitOut)\n\n\nOr use simInitAndSpades2()\n\n\nCode\n## remove validation module, can only be run after simulation's done\nout$modules &lt;- out$modules[out$modules != \"Biomass_validationKNN\"]  \nsimOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::simInitAndSpades2(out)\n\n\n\n15.3.1.1 Inspect the workflow, its inputs, outputs and parameters\nNow that we have a simulation we can inspect it. Let’s assume you initialised and ran your simulation with two separate simInit2() and spades() calls.\nInspect module connections and between-module object flows:\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::moduleDiagram(simInitOut)\nSpaDES.core::objectDiagram(simInitOut)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLandR vegetation module ‘connections’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject flows between modules (truncated).\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the scheduling of the init events in simInitOut and how simOut has future events scheduled too – thanks to this, we can extend the simulation beyond the original SpaDES.core::end(sim) of 2031 (Extend the simulation).\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::events(simInitOut)\nSpaDES.core::events(simOut)\n\n\nWe can also have a look at the completed events:\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::completed(simInitOut)\nSpaDES.core::completed(simOut)\n\n\nFinally, the following accessor functions will show a list of model inputs, outputs and parameters:\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::inputs(simOut)\nSpaDES.core::outputs(simOut)\nSpaDES.core::parameters(simOut)\n\n\nWe could even plot some of the input and output rasters to check that they are as we expected – no need to look for these objects files, they are all in the simList.\n\n\nCode\n## spatial inputs from list above\nterra::plot(simOut$studyAreaLarge, col = \"navyblue\", main = \"studyArea & studyAreaLarge\")\nterra::plot(simOut$studyArea, col = \"lightblue\", add = TRUE)\n\n## spatial outputs from list above\nterra::plot(simOut$vegTypeMap, \n            col = hcl.colors(palette = \"Dynamic\", n = length(unique(simOut$vegTypeMap[]))), \n            main = \"\")\nterra::plot(simOut$speciesLayers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy areas used for parameterisation (dark blue) and simulation (light blue).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year’s vegetation type map (leading species).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent cover of species retained for simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspecting inputs and outputs directly from the simList\n\n\n\nMore importantly in our view, is the ability to inspect statistical models used to fit model parameters. This is possible because the developers have declared the fitted statistical model objects as module outputs. Often, this type of information is buried in supplementary materials of papers and incomplete (e.g. coefficients and goodness-of-fit statistics are presented, but the entire model object, with its fitted values, residuals, etc., are not).\nBy exporting entire model objects, and making them available via repeatable code or data repositories, model transparency and potential scrutiny are massively increased.\n\n\nCode\n## model used to estimate species establishment probabilities\nsummary(simOut$modelBiomass$mod)\nplot(simOut$modelBiomass$mod)\n\n## model used to calibrate Picea glauca's growth parameters\nsummary(simOut$speciesGrowthCurves$Pice_Gla$NonLinearModel$Pice_Gla)\n\n\n\n\n15.3.1.2 Turn plotting on after setting up the workflow\nWe can change parameters and re-run the simulation to, e.g., activate live plotting in Biomass_core, without having to\n\nchange the parameter provided to setupProject\nrepeat the setupProject call\n\nNote that because simOut is actually a copy of simInitOut (see the output of SpaDES.core::completed(simInitOut)), this still means that simInitOut has to be re-generated for this purpose, otherwise spades would try to resume the simulation from the “last year”.\nThanks to internal caching, it will only take seconds to “redo” simInitOut. You will also notice that init events are retrieved from cache, this time around.\n\n\nCode\nsimInitOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::simInit2(out)\nSpaDES.core::P(simInitOut, param = \".plots\", module = \"Biomass_core\") &lt;- \"screen\"\nSpaDES.core::P(simInitOut, param = \".plotMaps\", module = \"Biomass_core\") &lt;- TRUE\nsimOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::spades(simInitOut)\n\n\n\n\n15.3.1.3 Extend the simulation\nWe can also keep it going for a few more years. Use SpaDES.core::end() to extend the simulation another 20 years and then call SpaDES.core::spades() on the changed simList (not the one output by `SpaDES.core::simInit2()) to resume the simulation from 2031.\n\n\nCode\nSpaDES.core::end(simOut) &lt;- 2061\nsimOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::spades(simOut)\n\n\n\n\n\n15.3.2 Many replicates\nDynamic ecological models like LandR often simulate stochastic ecological processes, like dispersal, probability of germination, or fire spread (see Chapter 16), which requires replicating simulations. The number of replicates will largely depend on the variability generated by the model. The more variability, the more replicates needed.\nThe set of LandR modules used here generates little variation in tree species dynamics and 10 replicates are sufficient.\nWe use SpaDES.experiment::experiment2() to do two things:\n\nCreate a folder structure by replicate to store the simulation outputs\nGenerate 10 independent simulations and run them in sequence\n\nor in parallel (Listing 15.2), using the future package.\n\n\nThis time we will specify a list of output objects to be saved for model validation later.\n\n\n\n\nListing 15.1: Sequential replication\n\n\nsimInitOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::simInit2(out)\n\noutputsDF &lt;- rbind(\n  data.frame(\n    objectName = \"cohortData\", \n    saveTime = seq(SpaDES.core::start(simInitOut), SpaDES.core::end(simInitOut))\n  ),\n  data.frame(\n    objectName = \"pixelGroupMap\", \n    saveTime = seq(SpaDES.core::start(simInitOut), SpaDES.core::end(simInitOut))\n  )\n)\nSpaDES.core::outputs(simInitOut) &lt;- outputsDF\n\nfuture::plan(\"sequential\")\nsimOutExperiment &lt;- SpaDES.experiment::experiment2(simInitOut, replicates = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListing 15.2: Parallel replication\n\n\nfuture::plan(\"multisession\", workers = 5)\nsimOutExperiment &lt;- SpaDES.experiment::experiment2(simInitOut, replicates = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.3.3 Validation\nNow that we have several replicates, we can use Biomass_validationKNN to run some validation statistics.\nIntegrating model validation as part of an ecological modelling workflow ensures that when model predictions are repeated under the same or different conditions, or new data arrives for validation, they can be readily (re-evaluated).\nNote that, for convenience, we use simOut to access many of the necessary inputs for Biomass_validationKNN, but we could have used one of the simLists in simOutExperiment instead.\n\n\nCode\noutValid &lt;- setupProject(\n  paths = list(\"packagePath\" = \"packages/\",\n               \"projectPath\" = \"~/SpaDES_book/LandRDemo_coreVeg\"),\n  options = list(\n    \"LandR.assertions\" = TRUE,\n    \"reproducible.destinationPath\" = paths$inputPath,\n    \"spades.inputPath\" = paths$inputPath,\n    \"spades.moduleCodeChecks\" = FALSE,\n    \"repos\" = repos\n  ),\n  modules = c(\n    \"PredictiveEcology/Biomass_validationKNN@main\"\n  ),\n  ## SIMULATION SETUP ------------------------------------\n  times = list(start = 1, end = 1),\n  ## INPUT OBJECTS -----------------------------------\n  studyArea = simOut$studyArea,\n  rasterToMatch = simOut$rasterToMatch,\n  rawBiomassMapStart = simOut$rawBiomassMap,\n  simulationOutputs = rbindlist(lapply(simOutExperiment, SpaDES.core::outputs)),\n  sppEquiv = simOut$sppEquiv,\n  sppEquivCol = simOut$sppEquivCol,\n  sppColorVect = simOut$sppColorVect,\n  speciesLayersStart = simOut$speciesLayers\n)\n\nsimOutValid &lt;- SpaDES.core::simInitAndSpades2(outValid)\n\n\n\n\n15.3.4 Different scenarios and model selection\nIn Barros et al. (2023), the model was run with two different parameterisation approaches one that was “data hungry” and calibrated tree species growth parameters and a simpler one that used default parameter values (without Biomass_speciesParameters).\nBy swapping parameterisation/calibration modules in and out \n\n\nCode\nsimOutExperiment &lt;- SpaDES.experiment::experiment2(simInitOut, replicates = 10)\n\n\n\n15.3.4.1 Debugging\nThere are several ways to debug SpaDES modules (see Chapter 13), a relatively easy one for when you are suprised by an error occurring during specific event is to pass the event’s name to spades(..., debug = ) argument.\nBelow, we debug the plotSummaryBySpecies event of Biomass_core. R interrupts the execution of the code in the chunk that executes this event’s operations (inside doEvent.Biomass_core())\n\n\nCode\nsimOut &lt;- SpaDES.core::spades(simInitOut, debug = \"plotSummaryBySpecies\")\n\n\nR interrupts code execution during this event’s operations (inside doEvent.Biomass_core()):\ndebugging in: get(moduleCall, envir = fnEnv)(sim, cur[[\"eventTime\"]], cur[[\"eventType\"]])\ndebug at C:/Users/cbarros/Documents/SpaDES_book/LandRDemo_coreVeg/modules/Biomass_core/Biomass_core.R#314: {\n(...)\nFrom there you can press ENTER, F10 or the “Next” button to execute the code line-by-line. At some point you will get to this line:\n\n\nCode\nsim &lt;- plotSummaryBySpecies(sim)\n\n\nwhich calls the function that effectively makes the summary plots. If you spotted a problem during the plotSummaryBySpecies event (or maybe you want to see what it does and/or change the code) and it hasn’t been triggered yet, then it’s likely it happened in this function.\nBefore running the line you can debugonce(plotSummaryBySpecies) to enable debugging the function and spot the issue.\nAnother option would be to insert a browser() at the top of the function’s definition inside the module code or the R scripts in the module’s R/ folder (&lt;modulePath&gt;/&lt;module_name&gt;/R/). In this case look for plotSummaryBySpecies &lt;- compiler::cmpfun(function(sim) {...} inside the module code (Biomass_core.R) and try putting a browser() inside the {}",

    "text": "Script, script, script – this means script everything you do, including package installation;\n“DOComment” your code – use comments that describe the intention of the code, not necessarily a code translation into human language:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimize the number of software/languages used – the more jumps between languages/software the less robust and reproducible the workflow is. Remember: other users will need to install the same software and be able to the same jumps/operations that you did without you looking over their shoulder.\nModularise and “functionise” – avoid loooooong scripts, which are harder to read, learn and debug.\nSpaDES helps the modularisation part a great deal but it is still up to the developer to create functions and to decide what workflow components can/should be broken into separate modules or events;\nWhen using embedded module and event caching, think about what workflow steps can be cached to speed up development and re-runs and consider turning these into separate modules or events;\nConsider “packaging” your functions so they can be used across projects and SpaDES modules.\n\n\n\nCentralize workflow in a single script – this is quite intuitive when using SpaDES, as usually there is a “controller” script that sets up and runs the workflow.\nUse project-oriented and self-contained workflows – pick a structure that is self-explanatory and make sure that the project can be “moved” between users/machines without changing the code.\nDon’t use absolute paths – use relative paths (relative to project directory) – RStudio Projects and SpaDES.project do this automatically.\nYou can even install your R packages into project-level libraries, to allow for different package versions between projects in the same machine\nVersion control – great for collaboration, great for tracking changes, great to recover old versions of a project/code\nTest (!) – test your code and your workflow if you want them to endure and persist through time and users\nUse a combination of assertions, unit tests and integration tests1",

When objects are in modules, you can add default object values (e.g. via .inputObjects), or save them into files that are loaded by setupProject or simInit. See\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not? There are many reasons why things can get messed up with modelling in R… e.g., package dependency issues (especially version numbers that collide during development stages), internet availability, modules finding objects in the .GlobalEnv when they shouldn’t, etc… SpaDES.project::setupProject and simInit deal with these issues by loading and using namespaces/packages and objects directly into a separate environment (the simList).\nDon’t install packages “manually” and “separately” – script package installation in a reproducible way, i.e. that includes reference to package versions. Even better, let setupProject deal with package installation\nWhy not? When you have many modules, each with a list of packages it needs it will be hard to figure out what packages need to be installed or updated. setupProject was designed to deal with this issue using the Require package.\nDon’t pre-load packages – let simInit do it when the simulation is being initialized and only after it has asserted that packages are available and in the correct versions.\nWhy not? There are many reasons why things can get messed up with modelling in R… e.g., package dependency issues (especially version numbers that collide during development stages), internet availability. Pre-loading a package prevents it from being updated, which can make setupProject (and simInit) fail if they attempt to update a package to respect module requirements.",
